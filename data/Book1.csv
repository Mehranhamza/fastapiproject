name,age,"      Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:                          I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""The reward of deeds depends upon the      intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he      has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman     to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."""
John,25,"      Narrated 'Aisha:                          (the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah's Apostle ""O Allah's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."" 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over)."
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Aisha:                       (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, ""I do not know how to read."" The Prophet added, ""The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, ""I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija replied, ""Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.""  Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, ""Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!"" Waraqa asked, ""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" Allah's Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, ""This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out."" Allah's Apostle asked, ""Will they drive me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, ""Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet ""While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran):                       'O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the people against Allah's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Said bin Jubair:                          Ibn 'Abbas in the explanation of the statement of Allah ""Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith."" (75.16) said ""Allah's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration."" Ibn 'Abbas moved his lips saying, ""I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah's Apostle used to move his."" Said moved his lips saying: ""I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn 'Abbas moving his."" Ibn 'Abbas added, ""So Allah revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran)' (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet) remember the portion of the Qur'an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The statement of Allah: 'And when we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Quran) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:                          Allah's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used      to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel      met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him      the Qur'an. Allah's Apostle was the most generous person, even more      generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste      to do charitable deeds)."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:                          Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to     him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were      merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and      Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan      and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to      Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and      he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his      translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, ""Who      amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a      Prophet?"" Abu Sufyan replied, ""I am the nearest relative to him      (amongst the group).""     Heraclius said, ""Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his      companions stand behind him."" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his      translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions      to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they      (my companions) should contradict me."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah!      Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked      me about him was:     'What is his family status amongst you?'      I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.'      Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the      same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'     I replied, 'No.'     He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'     I replied, 'No.'     Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'     I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'     He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'     I replied, 'They are increasing.'     He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion      become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'     I replied, 'No.'     Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his      claim (to be a Prophet)?'     I replied, 'No. '     Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'     I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he      will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against      him except that.     Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'     I replied, 'Yes.'     Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'     I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'     Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'     I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to      worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our      ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be      chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked      you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very      noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families      amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody      else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that      this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you      whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the      negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought      that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he      said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered      how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a      lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed      him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him.      And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of      people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or      decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further      asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his      religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when      its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked      you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and      likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered      you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah      alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to      worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be      chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this      place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he      was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and      if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him      and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius      then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded      it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows:      ""In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is)      from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the      ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path.      Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will     be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this      invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your      Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)     'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that      we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship      with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.     Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those      who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).     Abu Sufyan then added, ""When Heraclius had finished his speech and had     read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So      we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the      question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so      prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of     him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the      conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided      me to it).""     The sub narrator adds, ""Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya'      (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn      An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya'      (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his      priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller      and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared      (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The      people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you     should not be afraid of them (Jews).     'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan     to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in.      Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after      seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then      asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice     circumcision.'     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who      was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs.      (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his      letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the      emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that      Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his      palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of      his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If      success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your      empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet      (i.e. embrace Islam).'     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates      of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius      realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in      audience.     (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the      strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of      Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith)."
Sarah,30,      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Allah's Apostle said: Islam is based on (the following) five      (principles):     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.     2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and      perfectly.     3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity) .     4. To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)     5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Musa:                          Some people asked Allah's Apostle, ""Whose Islam is the best? i.e. (Who     is a very good Muslim)?"" He replied, ""One who avoids harming the      Muslims with his tongue and hands."""

The one to whom Allah and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything      else.     2. Who loves a person and he loves him only for Allah's sake.     3.

Not to join anything in worship along with Allah.     2. Not to steal.     3. Not to commit illegal sexual intercourse.     4. Not to kill your children.     5. Not to accuse an innocent person (to spread such an accusation      among people).     6. Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed.""     The Prophet added: ""Whoever among you fulfills his pledge will be      rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the     ascription of partners to Allah) and gets the punishment in this      world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin. And if one      indulges in any of them, and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him      to forgive or punish him (in the Hereafter)."" 'Ubada bin As-Samit      added: ""So we swore allegiance for these."" (points to Allah's      Apostle)"
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:                          Allah's Apostle said, ""A time will come that the best property of a      Muslim will be sheep which he will take on the top of mountains and      the places of rainfall (valleys) so as to flee with his religion from      afflictions."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Aisha:                          Whenever Allah's Apostle ordered the Muslims to do something, he used      to order them deeds which were easy for them to do, (according to      their strength endurance). They said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We are not      like you. Allah  has forgiven your past and future sins."" So Allah's      Apostle became angry and it was apparent on his face.

So they will be taken out but (by then) they will be      blackened (charred). Then they will be put in the river of Haya'      (rain) or Hayat (life) (the Narrator is in doubt as to which is the      right term), and they will revive like a grain that grows near the      bank of a flood channel.

I asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that      person? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer."" The Prophet      commented: ""Or merely a Muslim."" I remained quiet for a while, but      could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him.     And then asked Allah's Apostle, ""Why have you left so and so? By      Allah! He is a faithful believer."" The Prophet again said, ""Or merely      a Muslim."" And I could not help repeating my question because of what      I knew about him. Then the Prophet said, ""O Sa'd! I give to a person      while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his     face in the Fire by Allah."""

It was asked, ""Do they      disbelieve in Allah?"" (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied,      ""They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the      favors and the good (charitable deeds) done to them.

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Al-Ma'rur:                          At Ar-Rabadha I met Abu Dhar who was wearing a cloak, and his slave,      too, was wearing a similar one. I asked about the reason for it. He      replied, ""I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names."" The     Prophet said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his      mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of      ignorance. Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under      your command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed      him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them      (slaves) to do things beyond their capacity (power) and if you do so,      then help them.' """

I replied, ""I am going to help      that person."" He said, ""Go back for I have heard Allah's Apostle      saying, 'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords,      both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.'

Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Abdullah:                          When the following Verse was revealed: ""It is those who believe and      confuse not their belief with wrong (worshipping others besides      Allah.)""

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          The Prophet said, ""The signs of a hypocrite are three:     1. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.     2. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise ).     3. If you trust him, he proves to be dishonest. (If you keep something     as a trust with him, he will not return it.)"""

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Al-Bara' (bin 'Azib):                          When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers     or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing      Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he      wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first      prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the      company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer      with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were      bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing      them, ""By Allah, I testify that I have prayed with Allah's Apostle      facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their      direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the      scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in      prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during      the prayers, they disapproved of it.     Al-Bara' added, ""Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba      (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we      did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Allah      then revealed: And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be      lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).' "" (2:143)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa'id Al Khudri:                     Allah's Messenger () said, ""If a person embraces Islam sincerely, then Allah shall forgive all his past sins, and after that starts the settlement of accounts, the reward of his good deeds will be ten times to seven hundred times for each good deed and one evil deed will be recorded as it is unless Allah forgives it."""

Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Aisha:                          Once the Prophet came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, ""Who     is she?"" I replied, ""She is so and so,"" and told him about her      (excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, ""Do (good) deeds which is     within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Allah does not get      tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best     deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Allah is that which is done      regularly."""

Allah's Apostle said, ""You have to offer prayers perfectly five times      in a day and night (24 hours)."" The man asked, ""Is there any more      (praying)?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""No, but if you want to offer the     Nawafil prayers (you can)."" Allah's Apostle further said to him: ""You      have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan."" The man asked,      ""Is there any more fasting?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""No, but if you      want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)"" Then Allah's Apostle      further said to him, ""You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity).""     The man asked, ""Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to      pay?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""No, unless you want to give alms of      your own."" And then that man retreated saying, ""By Allah! I will      neither do less nor more than this."" Allah's Apostle said, ""If what he     said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted      Paradise)."""

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people,      (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, ""What is faith?"" Allah's Apostle      replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with     Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection."" Then he further      asked, ""What is Islam?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""To worship Allah      Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory      charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.""       Then he further asked, ""What is Ihsan (perfection)?"" Allah's Apostle      replied, ""To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot      achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is      looking at you."" Then he further asked, ""When will the Hour be      established?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""The answerer has no better      knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its      portents.     1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.     2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing      with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is      one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.     The Prophet then recited: ""Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge     of the Hour--."" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet      asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him.      Then the Prophet said, ""That was Gabriel who came to teach the people      their religion."" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all      that as a part of faith."

I further asked you      whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his (the Prophets)      religion (Islam) became displeased and discarded it. You replied in      the negative, and in fact, this is (a sign of) true faith. When its      delight enters the heart and mixes with them completely, nobody can be     displeased with it."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated An-Nu'man bin Bashir:                          I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are      evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and     most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves      himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor.     And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who     grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else      and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every     king has a Hima and the Hima of Allah on the earth is His illegal      (forbidden) things. Beware!

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Jamra:                          I used to sit with Ibn 'Abbas and he made me sit on his sitting place.     He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a      share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he      told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of 'Abdul Qais came to     the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, ""Who are the people (i.e. you)?      (Or) who are the delegate?"" They replied, ""We are from the tribe of      Rabi'a."" Then the Prophet said to them, ""Welcome! O people (or O      delegation of 'Abdul Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will      you regret."" They said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We cannot come to you      except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar      intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something      good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have      left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on      them)."" Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is      illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them      from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked      them, ""Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?"" They      replied, ""Allah and His Apostle know better."" Thereupon the Prophet      said, ""It means:     1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and      Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.      2. To offer prayers perfectly     3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)      4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.     5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's     Cause).     Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann      Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic     drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and     he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them):      ""Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom     you have left behind."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab:                          Allah's Apostle said, ""The reward of deeds depends upon the intention      and every person will get the reward according to what he has      intended.

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Mas'ud:                          The Prophet said, ""If a man spends on his family (with the intention      of having a reward from Allah) sincerely for Allah's sake then it is a     (kind of) alms-giving in reward for him."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas:                          Allah's Apostle said, ""You will be rewarded for whatever you spend for     Allah's sake even if it were a morsel which you put in your wife's      mouth."""
Sarah,30,      Narrated Jarir bin Abdullah:                          I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle for the following:     1. offer prayers perfectly      2. pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)     3. and be sincere and true to every Muslim.
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ziyad bin'Ilaqa:                          I heard Jarir bin 'Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when      Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and      thanked and praised Allah and said, ""Be afraid of Allah alone Who has      none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet      till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask      Allah's forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to      forgive others."" Jarir added, ""Amma badu (now then), I went to the      Prophet and said, 'I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam.""      The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to      every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this      mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims).

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came and asked him, ""When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?"" Allah's Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some of them said that Allah's Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet finished his speech, he said, ""Where is the questioner, who inquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?"" The Bedouin said, ""I am here, O Allah's Apostle ."" Then the Prophet said, ""When honesty is lost, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday)."" The Bedouin said, ""How will that be lost?""

He made his camel kneel down in the mosque, tied its foreleg and then said: ""Who amongst you is Muhammad?"" At that time the Prophet was sitting amongst us (his companions) leaning on his arm. We replied, ""This white man reclining on his arm."" The man then addressed him, ""O Son of `Abdul Muttalib."" The Prophet said, ""I am here to answer your questions.""

Two of them came in front of Allah's Apostle and the third one went away. The two persons kept on standing before Allah's Apostle for a while and then one of them found a place in the circle and sat there while the other sat behind the gathering, and the third one went away. When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, ""Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook himself to Allah, so Allah took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second felt shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from Allah and went away, so Allah turned His face from him likewise.

We kept quiet, thinking that he might give that day another name. He said, ""Isn't it the day of Nahr (slaughtering of the animals of sacrifice)"" We replied, ""Yes."" He further asked, ""Which month is this?"" We again kept quiet, thinking that he might give it another name. Then he said, ""Isn't it the month of Dhul-Hijja?"" We replied, ""Yes."" He said, ""Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another (i.e. Muslims) like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours.

(And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will keep on following Allah's teachings strictly and they will not be harmed by any one going on a different path till Allah's order (Day of Judgment) is established."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     We were with the Prophet and fresh dates of a palm tree were brought to him. On that he said, ""Amongst the trees, there is a tree which resembles a Muslim."" I wanted to say that it was the datepalm tree but as I was the youngest of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the Prophet said, ""It is the date-palm tree."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     The Prophet said, ""Do not wish to be like anyone except in two cases. (The first is) A person, whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it righteously; (the second is) the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Qur'an) and he acts according to it and teaches it to others."" (Fath-al-Bari page 177 Vol. 1)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     That he differed with Hur bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari regarding the companion of (the Prophet) Moses. Ibn `Abbas said that he was Al Khadir. Meanwhile, Ubai bin Ka`b passed by them and Ibn `Abbas called him, saying ""My friend (Hur) and I have differed regarding Moses' companion, whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard the Prophet mentioning something about him? He said, ""Yes. I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked him. ""Do you know anyone who is more learned than you? Moses replied: ""No."" So Allah sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, Our slave Khadir (is more learned than you.)' Moses asked (Allah) how to meet him (Khadir). So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return (to the place where he had lost it) and there he would meet him (Al-Khadir). So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant-boy of Moses said to him: Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. On that Moses said: 'That is what we have been seeking? (18.64) So they went back retracing their footsteps, and found Khadir. (And) what happened further to them is narrated in the Holy Qur'an by Allah. (18.54 up to 18.82)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once the Prophet embraced me and said, ""O Allah! Bestow on him the knowledge of the Book (Qur'an)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once I came riding a she-ass and had (just) attained the age of puberty. Allah's Apostle was offering the prayer at Mina. There was no wall in front of him and I passed in front of some of the row while they were offering their prayers. There I let the she-ass loose to graze and entered the row, and nobody objected to it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mahmud bin Rabi`a:                     When I was a boy of five, I remember, the Prophet took water from a bucket (used far getting water out of a well) with his mouth and threw it on my face."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     that he differed with Hur bin Qais bin Hisn Al-Fazari regarding the companion of the Prophet Moses.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""From among the portents of the Hour are (the following): -1. Religious knowledge will be taken away (by the death of Religious learned men). -2. (Religious) ignorance will prevail. -3. Drinking of Alcoholic drinks (will be very common). -4. There will be prevalence of open illegal sexual intercourse."
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     I will narrate to you a Hadith and none other than I will tell you about after it. I heard Allah's Apostle saying: From among the portents of the Hour are (the following): -1. Religious knowledge will decrease (by the death of religious learned men). -2. Religious ignorance will prevail. -3. There will be prevalence of open illegal sexual intercourse. -4. Women will increase in number and men will decrease in number so much so that fifty women will be looked after by one man.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""While I was sleeping, I saw that a cup full of milk was brought to me and I drank my fill till I noticed (the milk) its wetness coming out of my nails. Then I gave the remaining milk to `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab"" The companions of the Prophet asked, ""What have you interpreted (about this dream)? ""O Allah's Apostle ,!"" he replied, ""(It is religious) knowledge."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al `Aas:                     Allah's Apostle stopped (for a while near the Jimar) at Mina during his last Hajj for the people and they were asking him questions. A man came and said, ""I forgot and got my head shaved before slaughtering the Hadi (sacrificing animal)."" The Prophet said, ""There is no harm, go and do the slaughtering now."" Then another person came and said, ""I forgot and slaughtered (the camel) before Rami (throwing of the pebbles) at the Jamra."" The Prophet said, ""Do the Rami now and there is no harm."" The narrator added: So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about anything (as regards the ceremonies of Hajj) performed before or after its due time, his reply was: ""Do it (now) and there is no harm."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Somebody said to the Prophet (during his last Hajj), ""I did the slaughtering before doing the Rami.' The Prophet beckoned with his hand and said, ""There is no harm in that."" Then another person said. ""I got my head shaved before offering the sacrifice."" The Prophet beckoned with his hand saying, ""There is no harm in that."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""(Religious) knowledge will be taken away (by the death of religious scholars) ignorance (in religion) and afflictions will appear; and Harj will increase."" It was asked, ""What is Harj, O Allah's Apostle?"" He replied by beckoning with his hand indicating ""killing."" (Fath-al-Bari Page 192, Vol. 1)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Asma':                     I came to `Aisha while she was praying, and said to her, ""What has happened to the people?"" She pointed out towards the sky. (I looked towards the mosque), and saw the people offering the prayer. Aisha said, ""Subhan Allah."" I said to her, ""Is there a sign?"" She nodded with her head meaning, ""Yes."" I, too, then stood (for the prayer of eclipse) till I became (nearly) unconscious and later on I poured water on my head. After the prayer, the Prophet praised and glorified Allah and then said, ""Just now at this place I have seen what I have never seen before, including Paradise and Hell. No doubt it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like the trials of Masih-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure which expression Asma' used). You will be asked, 'What do you know about this man (the Prophet Muhammad)?' Then the faithful believer (or Asma' said a similar word) will reply, 'He is Muhammad Allah's Apostle who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance and so we accepted his teachings and followed him. And he is Muhammad.' And he will repeat it thrice. Then the angels will say to him, 'Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful believer.' On the other hand, a hypocrite or a doubtful person will reply, 'I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so I said it.' (the same). """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Jamra:                     I was an interpreter between the people and Ibn `Abbas. Once Ibn `Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of `Abdul Qais came to the Prophet who asked them, ""Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are the delegates?"" They replied, ""We are from the tribe of Rabi`a."" Then the Prophet said to them, ""Welcome, O people (or said, ""O delegation (of `Abdul Qais)."") Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret."" They said, ""We have come to you from a distant place and there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you and us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please order us to do something good (religious deeds) and that we may also inform our people whom we have left behind (at home) and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them.)"" The Prophet ordered them to do four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, ""Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?"" They replied, ""Allah and His Apostle know better."" Thereupon the Prophet said, ""(That means to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's cause)."" Then he forbade them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.' Hantam, Muzaffat (and) An-Naqir or Muqaiyar (These were the names of pots in which alcoholic drinks used to be prepared). The Prophet further said, ""Memorize them (these instructions) and tell them to the people whom you have left behind."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Mulaika:                     `Uqba bin Al-Harith said that he had married the daughter of Abi Ihab bin `Aziz. Later on a woman came to him and said, ""I have suckled (nursed) `Uqba and the woman whom he married (his wife) at my breast."" `Uqba said to her, ""Neither I knew that you have suckled (nursed) me nor did you tell me."" Then he rode over to see Allah's Apostle at Medina, and asked him about it. Allah's Apostle said, ""How can you keep her as a wife when it has been said (that she is your foster-sister)?"" Then `Uqba divorced her, and she married another man."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     My Ansari neighbor from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live at `Awali Al-Medina and used to visit the Prophet by turns. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and asked if I was there."" I became horrified and came out to him. He said, ""Today a great thing has happened."" I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked her, ""Did Allah's Apostle divorce you all?"" She replied, ""I do not know."" Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said while standing, ""Have you divorced your wives?"" The Prophet replied in the negative. On what I said, ""Allahu-Akbar (Allah is Greater)."" (See Hadith No. 119, Vol. 3 for details)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari:                     Once a man said to Allah's Apostle ""O Allah's Apostle! I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: ""I never saw the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, ""O people! Some of you make others dislike good deeds (the prayers). So whoever leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them there are the sick the weak and the needy (having some jobs to do)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:                     A man asked the Prophet about the picking up of a ""Luqata"" (fallen lost thing). The Prophet replied, ""Recognize and remember its tying material and its container, and make public announcement (about it) for one year, then utilize it but give it to its owner if he comes."" Then the person asked about the lost camel. On that, the Prophet got angry and his cheeks or his Face became red and he said, ""You have no concern with it as it has its water container, and its feet and it will reach water, and eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds it."" The man then asked about the lost sheep. The Prophet replied, ""It is either for you, for your brother (another person) or for the wolf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet was asked about things which he did not like, but when the questioners insisted, the Prophet got angry. He then said to the people, ""Ask me anything you like."" A man asked, ""Who is my father?"" The Prophet replied, ""Your father is Hudhafa."" Then another man got up and said, ""Who is my father, O Allah's Apostle ?"" He replied, ""Your father is Salim, Maula (the freed slave) of Shaiba."" So when `Umar saw that (the anger) on the face of the Prophet he said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We repent to Allah (Our offending you)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     One day Allah's Apostle came out (before the people) and `Abdullah bin Hudhafa stood up and asked (him) ""Who is my father?"" The Prophet replied, ""Your father is Hudhafa."" The Prophet told them repeatedly (in anger) to ask him anything they liked. `Umar knelt down before the Prophet and said thrice, ""We accept Allah as (our) Lord and Islam as (our) religion and Muhammad as (our) Prophet."" After that the Prophet became silent."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Whenever the Prophet asked permission to enter, he knocked the door thrice with greeting and whenever he spoke a sentence (said a thing) he used to repeat it thrice. (See Hadith No. 261, Vol. 8)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Whenever the Prophet spoke a sentence (said a thing), he used to repeat it thrice so that the people could understand it properly from him and whenever he asked permission to enter, (he knocked the door) thrice with greeting."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:                     Once Allah's Apostle remained behind us in a journey. He joined us while we were performing ablution for the `Asr prayer which was over-due. We were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them properly) so the Prophet addressed us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice, ""Save your heels from the fire."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Burda's father:                          Allah's Apostle said ""Three persons will have a double reward:     1. A Person from the people of the scriptures who believed in his      prophet (Jesus or Moses) and then believed in the Prophet Muhammad (i      .e. has embraced Islam).     2. A slave who discharges his duties to Allah and his master.     3. A master of a woman-slave who teaches her good manners and educates     her in the best possible way (the religion) and manumits her and then      marries her."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:                          Once Allah's Apostle came out while Bilal was accompanying him. He      went towards the women thinking that they had not heard him (i.e. his      sermon). So he preached them and ordered them to pay alms. (Hearing      that) the women started giving alms; some donated their ear-rings,      some gave their rings and Bilal was collecting them in the corner of      his garment."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     I said: ""O Allah's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person, who will gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?"" Allah's Apostle said: O Abu Huraira! ""I have thought that none will ask me about it before you as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hadiths. The luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who said sincerely from the bottom of his heart ""None has the right to be worshipped but Allah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""Allah does not take away the knowledge, by taking it away from (the hearts of) the people, but takes it away by the death of the religious learned men till when none of the (religious learned men) remains, people will take as their leaders ignorant persons who when consulted will give their verdict without knowledge. So they will go astray and will lead the people astray."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as the men were taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious lessons and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, ""A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the Hell fire."" On that a woman asked, ""If only two die?"" He replied, ""Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     as above (the sub narrators are different). Abu Huraira qualified the three children referred to in the above mentioned Hadith as not having reached the age of committing sins (i.e. age of puberty) .
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:                     Whenever `Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it completely. Aisha said: ""Once the Prophet said, ""Whoever will be called to account (about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will surely be punished."" I said, ""Doesn't Allah say: ""He surely will receive an easy reckoning."" (84.8) The Prophet replied, ""This means only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued about his account, will certainly be ruined."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id:                     Abu Shuraih said, ""When `Amr bin Sa`id was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight `Abdullah bin Az- Zubair) I said to him, 'O chief! Allow me to tell you what the Prophet said on the day following the conquests of Mecca. My ears heard and my heart comprehended, and I saw him with my own eyes, when he said it. He glorified and praised Allah and then said, ""Allah and not the people has made Mecca a sanctuary. So anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day (i.e. a Muslim) should neither shed blood in it nor cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting is allowed in Mecca as Allah's Apostle did fight (in Mecca), tell him that Allah gave permission to His Apostle, but He did not give it to you. The Prophet added: Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today (now) its sanctity is the same (valid) as it was before. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are absent."" Abu- Shuraih was asked, ""What did `Amr reply?"" He said `Amr said, ""O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you (in this respect). Mecca does not give protection to one who disobeys (Allah) or runs after committing murder, or theft (and takes refuge in Mecca)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakra:                     The Prophet said. No doubt your blood, property, the sub-narrator Muhammad thought that Abu Bakra had also mentioned and your honor (chastity), are sacred to one another as is the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours. It is incumbent on those who are present to inform those who are absent."" (Muhammad the Sub-narrator used to say, ""Allah's Apostle told the truth."") The Prophet repeated twice: ""No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Allah's message to you."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali:                     The Prophet said, ""Do not tell a lie against me for whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally) then he will surely enter the Hell-fire."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:                     I said to my father, 'I do not hear from you any narration (Hadith) of Allah s Apostle as I hear (his narration) from so and so?"" Az-Zubair replied. l was always with him (the Prophet) and I heard him saying ""Whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally) then (surely) let him occupy, his seat in Hellfire."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The fact which stops me from narrating a great number of Hadiths to you is that the Prophet said: ""Whoever tells a lie against me intentionally, then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""Whoever (intentionally) ascribes to me what I have not said then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Name yourselves with my name (use my name) but do not name yourselves with my Kunya name (i.e. Abul Qasim). And whoever sees me in a dream then surely he has seen me for Satan cannot impersonate me. And whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally), then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ash-Shu`bi:                     Abu Juhaifa said, ""I asked `Ali, 'Have you got any book (which has been revealed to the Prophet apart from the Qur'an)?' `Ali replied, 'No, except Allah's Book or the power of understanding which has been bestowed (by Allah) upon a Muslim or what is (written) in this sheet of paper (with me).' Abu Juhaifa said, ""I asked, 'What is (written) in this sheet of paper?' `Ali replied, it deals with The Diyya (compensation (blood money) paid by the killer to the relatives of the victim), the ransom for the releasing of the captives from the hands of the enemies, and the law that no Muslim should be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for the killing of (a disbeliever)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza`a killed a man from the tribe of Bani Laith in revenge for a killed person, belonging to them. They informed the Prophet about it. So he rode his Rahila (she-camel for riding) and addressed the people saying, ""Allah held back the killing from Mecca. (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet said ""elephant or killing,"" as the Arabic words standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Allah) let His Apostle and the believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it was made legal for me for few hours or so on that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is not allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqat (fallen things) except by a person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then his closest relative has the right to choose one of the two-- the blood money (Diyya) or retaliation having the killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Get that written for me."" The Prophet ordered his companions to write that for him. Then a man from Quraish said, ""Except Al-Idhkhir (a type of grass that has good smell) O Allah's Apostle, as we use it in our houses and graves."" The Prophet said, ""Except Al-Idhkhir i.e. Al-Idhkhir is allowed to be plucked."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     There is none among the companions of the Prophet who has narrated more Hadiths than I except `Abdullah bin `Amr (bin Al-`As) who used to write them and I never did the same.
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah:                     Ibn `Abbas said, ""When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.' But `Umar said, 'The Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me."" Ibn `Abbas came out saying, ""It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Hadith that Ibn `Abbas had witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is not so, for Ibn `Abbas used to say this statement on narrating the Hadith and he had not witnessed the event personally. See Fath Al-Bari Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.) (See Hadith No. 228, Vol. 4)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     One night Allah's Apostle got up and said, ""Subhan Allah! How many afflictions have been descended tonight and how many treasures have been disclosed! Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings (his wives) up (for prayers). A well-dressed (soul) in this world may be naked in the Hereafter. """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Once the Prophet led us in the `Isha' prayer during the last days of his life and after finishing it (the prayer) (with Taslim) he said: ""Do you realize (the importance of) this night?"" Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight will be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the wife of the Prophet ) while the Prophet was there with her during her night turn. The Prophet offered the `Isha' prayer (in the mosque), returned home and after having prayed four rak`at, he slept. Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five rak`at followed by two more rak`at. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's narration). Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are: ""Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful."" (2:159-160). And no doubt our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Allah's Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that which they used not to memorize."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     I said to Allah's Apostle ""I hear many narrations (Hadiths) from you but I forget them."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Spread your Rida' (garment)."" I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if filling them with something (and emptied them in my Rida') and then said, ""Take and wrap this sheet over your body."" I did it and after that I never forgot any thing.Narrated Ibrahim bin Al-Mundhir:Ibn Abi Fudaik narrated the same as above (Hadith...119) but added that the Prophet had moved his hands as if filling them with something and then he emptied them in the Rida' of Abu Huraira."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     I have memorized two kinds of knowledge from Allah's Apostle . I have propagated one of them to you and if I propagated the second, then my pharynx (throat) would be cut (i.e. killed)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jarir:                     The Prophet said to me during Hajjat-al-Wida`: Let the people keep quiet and listen. Then he said (addressing the people), ""Do not (become infidels) revert to disbelief after me by striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another (killing each other)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     I said to Ibn `Abbas, ""Nauf-Al-Bakali claims that Moses (the companion of Khadir) was not the Moses of Bani Israel but he was another Moses."" Ibn `Abbas remarked that the enemy of Allah (Nauf) was a liar.Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b:The Prophet said, ""Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, ""Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, ""I am the most learned."" Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him ""At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you."" Moses said, ""O my Lord! How can I meet him?"" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: ""Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey."" Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, ""Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish."" Moses remarked, ""That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, ""How do people greet each other in your land?"" Moses said, ""I am Moses."" He asked, ""The Moses of Bani Israel?"" Moses replied in the affirmative and added, ""May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know."" Moses said, ""Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the seashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: ""O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak."" Al- Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, ""These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me."" Moses said, ""Call me not to account for what I forgot."" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, ""Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?"" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, ""If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir replied, ""This is the parting between you and me."" The Prophet added, ""May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     A man came to the Prophet and asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! What kind of fighting is in Allah's cause? (I ask this), for some of us fight because of being enraged and angry and some for the sake of his pride and haughtiness."" The Prophet raised his head (as the questioner was standing) and said, ""He who fights so that Allah's Word (Islam) should be superior, then he fights in Allah's cause."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Ammar:                     I saw the Prophet near the Jamra and the people were asking him questions (about religious problems). A man asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have slaughtered the Hadi (animal) before doing the Rami."" The Prophet replied, ""Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm."" Another person asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal."" The Prophet replied, ""Do the slaughtering (now) and there is no harm."" So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time his reply was, ""Do it (now) and there is no harm."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, ""O Abul-Qasim ! What is the spirit?"" The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet then said, ""And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little)."" (17.85)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Aswad:                     Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, ""Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of things. What did she tell you about the Ka`ba?"" I replied, ""She told me that once the Prophet said, 'O `Aisha! Had not your people been still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I would have dismantled the Ka`ba and would have made two doors in it; one for entrance and the other for exit."" Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did the same."

Mu`adh replied, ""Labbaik and Sa`daik. O Allah's Apostle!"" Again the Prophet said, ""O Mu`adh!"" Mu`adh said thrice, ""Labbaik and Sa`daik, O Allah's Apostle!"" Allah's Apostle said, ""There is none who testifies sincerely that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is his Apostle, except that Allah, will save him from the Hell-fire."" Mu`adh said, ""O Allah's Apostle ! Should I not inform the people about it so that they may have glad tidings?"" He replied, ""When the people hear about it, they will solely depend on it."" Then Mu`adh narrated the above-mentioned Hadith just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not telling the knowledge)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     I was informed that the Prophet had said to Mu`adh, ""Whosoever will meet Allah without associating anything in worship with Him will go to Paradise.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     Um-Sulaim came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""Verily, Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth.

Um Salama, then covered her face and asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?""

Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas and I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). The others asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! inform us of it."" He replied, ""it is the date-palm tree."" I told my father what had come to my mind and on that he said, ""Had you said it I would have preferred it to such and such a thing that I might possess."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali:                     I used to get the emotional urethral discharge frequently so I requested Al-Miqdad to ask the Prophet about it. Al-Miqdad asked him and he replied, ""One has to perform ablution (after it)."" (See Hadith No. 269)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar said: ""A man got up in the mosque and said: O Allah's Apostle 'At which place you order us that we should assume the Ihram?'

I, too, performed a similar ablution, then I went and stood on his left. He drew me to his right and prayed as much as Allah wished, and again lay and slept till his breath sounds were heard.

One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet went out at `Isha' time and she was a tall lady. `Umar addressed her and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda.""

So we accepted his teaching, believed and followed him.' Then the angels will say to him to sleep in peace as they have come to know that he was a believer.

On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet ordered `Abdur Rahman (`Aisha's brother) to take me to at-Tan`im to assume the lhram for `Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-at-Tamattu` which I had intended to perform."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, ""Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for `Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed the Ihram for `Umra. ""Some of us assumed the Ihram for `Umra while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for `Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until the day of `Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He told me to postpone my `Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother `Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to at-Tan`im, where I assumed the Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, ""For that (`Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet said, ""At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, 'O Lord! A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh."" Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?' So all that is written while the child is still in the mother's womb."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     `Aisha said, ""We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj. Some of us intended to perform `Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca, Allah's Apostle said, 'Those who had assumed the lhram for `Umra and had not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the Ihram for `Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hadi and whoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj."" `Aisha further said, ""I got my periods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of `Arafat, and I had assumed the Ihram for `Umra only (Tamattu`). The Prophet ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj only and leave the `Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet sent `Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform `Umra from at-Tan`im in lieu of the missed `Umra."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Fatima bint Abi Hubaish used to have bleeding in between the periods, so she asked the Prophet about it . He replied, ""The bleeding is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So give up the prayers when the (real) menses begin and when it has finished, take a bath and start praying."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Mu`adha:                     A woman asked `Aisha, ""Should I offer the prayers that which I did not offer because of menses"" `Aisha said, ""Are you from the Huraura' (a town in Iraq?) We were with the Prophet and used to get our periods but he never ordered us to offer them (the Prayers missed during menses)."" `Aisha perhaps said, ""We did not offer them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:                     Um-Salama said, ""I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet under a woolen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses and put them on. Allah's Apostle said, 'Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' Then he called me and took me with him under the woolen sheet."" Um Salama further said, ""The Prophet used to kiss me while he was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of Janaba from a single pot."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     While I was lying with the Prophet under a woolen sheet, I got my menses. I slipped away and put on the clothes for menses. The Prophet said, ""Have you got your menses?"" I replied, ""Yes."" He called me and I slept with him under the woolen sheet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aiyub:                     Hafsa said, 'We used to forbid our young women to go out for the two `Id prayers. A woman came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and she narrated about her sister whose husband took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and her sister was with her husband in six (out of these twelve). She (the woman's sister) said, ""We used to treat the wounded, look after the patients and once I asked the Prophet, 'Is there any harm for any of us to stay at home if she doesn't have a veil?' He said, 'She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gathering of the Muslims.' When Um `Atiya came I asked her whether she had heard it from the Prophet. She replied, ""Yes. May my father be sacrificed for him (the Prophet)! (Whenever she mentioned the Prophet she used to say, 'May my father be sacrificed for him) I have heard the Prophet saying, 'The unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stay screened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).' "" Hafsa asked Um `Atiya surprisingly, ""Do you say the menstruating women?"" She replied, ""Doesn't a menstruating woman attend `Arafat (Hajj) and such and such (other deeds)?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Fatima bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet, ""I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers?"" He replied, ""No, this is from a blood vessel. Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Um `Atiya:                     We never considered yellowish discharge as a thing of importance (as menses).
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) Um Habiba got bleeding in between the periods for seven years. She asked Allah's Apostle about it. He ordered her to take a bath (after the termination of actual periods) and added that it was (from) a blood vessel. So she used to take a bath for every prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) I told Allah's Apostle that Safiya bint Huyai had got her menses. He said, ""She will probably delay us. Did she perform Tawaf (Al-Ifada) with you?"" We replied, ""Yes."" On that the Prophet told her to depart."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     A woman is allowed to leave (go back home) if she gets menses (after Tawaf-Al-Ifada). Ibn `Umar formerly used to say that she should not leave but later on I heard him saying, ""She may leave, since Allah's Apostle gave them the permission to leave (after Tawaf-Al-Ifada)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet said to me, ""Give up the prayer when your menses begin and when it has finished, wash the blood off your body (take a bath) and start praying."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Samura bin Jundub:                     The Prophet offered the funeral prayer for the dead body of a woman who died during delivery (i.e. childbirth) and he stood by the middle of her body.
Sarah,30," Narrated Maimuna:                     (the wife of the Prophet) During my menses, I never prayed, but used to sit on the mat beside the mosque of Allah's Apostle. He used to offer the prayer on his sheet and in prostration some of his clothes used to touch me."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allah's Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al- Baida' or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Allah's Apostle stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, ""Don't you see what `Aisha has done? She has made Allah's Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them."" Abu Bakr came while Allah's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh, He said, to me: ""You have detained Allah's Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them. So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah's Apostle on my thigh. Allah's Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, ""O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours."" Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me. -1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month's journey. -2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due. -3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me. -4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection). -5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been sent to all mankind."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa's father:                     Aisha said, ""I borrowed a necklace from Asma' and it was lost. So Allah's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed (without ablution) and informed Allah's Apostle about it, so the verse of Tayammum was revealed."" Usaid bin Hudair said to `Aisha, ""May Allah reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that."" Al-Jurf and the time for the `Asr prayer became due while he was at Marbad-An-Na`am (sheepfold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not repeat that prayer."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Juhaim Al-Ansari:                     The Prophet came from the direction of Bir Jamal. A man met him and greeted him. But he did not return back the greeting till he went to a (mud) wall and smeared his hands and his face with its dust (performed Tayammum) and then returned back the greeting.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin Abza [??]:                     A man came to `Umar bin Al-Khattab and said, ""I became Junub but no water was available."" `Ammar bin Yasir said to `Umar, ""Do you remember that you and I (became Junub while both of us) were together on a journey and you didn't pray but I rolled myself on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, 'It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.' The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin `Abdur Rahman bin Abza:                     (on the authority of his father who said) `Ammar said so (the above Statement). And Shu`ba stroked lightly the earth with his hands and brought them close to his mouth (blew off the dust) and passed them over his face and then the backs of his hands. `Ammar said, ""Ablution (meaning Tayammum here) is sufficient for a Muslim if water is not available."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin Abza:                     that while he was in the company of `Umar, `Ammar said to `Umar, ""We were in a detachment and became Junub and I blew the dust off my hands (performed the rolling over the earth and prayed.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin Abza:                     `Ammar said to `Umar ""I rolled myself in the dust and came to the Prophet who said, 'Passing dusted hands over the face and the backs of the hands is sufficient for you.' """
Sarah,30, Narrated `Ammar:                     As above.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Ammar:                     The Prophet stroked the earth with his hands and then passed them over his face and the backs of his hands (while demonstrating Tayammum).
Sarah,30," Narrated `Imran:                     Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator `Auf said that Abu Raja' had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was `Umar bin Al- Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, `Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, ""Allahu Akbar"" and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, ""There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!"" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, ""O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?"" He replied, ""I am Junub and there is no water. "" The Prophet said, ""Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."" Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator `Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and `Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, ""Where can we find water?"" She replied, ""I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me."" They requested her to accompany them. She asked, ""Where?"" They said, ""To Allah's Apostle ."" She said, ""Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?"" They replied, ""Yes, the same person. So come along."" They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, ""Help her to dismount."" The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah's Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of foodstuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, ""We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us."" She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: ""O so and so what has delayed you?"" She said, ""A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah's true Apostle."" Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, ""I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?"" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam. Abu `Abdullah said: The word Saba'a means ""The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion."" Abul 'Ailya [??] said, ""The S`Abis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wail:                     Abu Musa said to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, ""If one does not find water (for ablution) can he give up the prayer?"" `Abdullah replied, ""If you give the permission to perform Tayammum they will perform Tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold."" Abu Musa said, ""What about the statement of `Ammar to `Umar?"" `Abdullah replied, ""`Umar was not satisfied by his statement."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:                     I was with `Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, ""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?"" `Abdullah replied, ""Do not pray till water is found."" Abu Musa said, ""What do you say about the statement of `Ammar (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him: ""Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient."" `Abdullah replied, ""Don't you see that `Umar was not satisfied by `Ammar's statement?"" Abu- Musa said, ""All right, leave `Ammar's statement, but what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?"" `Abdullah kept quiet and then said, ""If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold."" The narrator added, ""I said to Shaqiq, ""Then did `Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?"" He replied, ""Yes."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-A`mash:                     Shaqiq said, ""While I was sitting with `Abdullah and Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, the latter asked the former, 'If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and offer his prayer?' (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, 'What do you say about this verse from Sura ""Al-Ma'ida"": When you do not find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? `Abdullah replied, 'If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean earth even if water were available but cold.' I said to Shaqiq, 'You then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?' Shaqiq said, 'Yes.' (Shaqiq added), ""Abu Musa said, 'Haven't you heard the statement of `Ammar to `Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah's Apostle for some job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the Prophet of that he said, 'Like this would have been sufficient.' The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.' So `Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, 'Don't you know that `Umar was not satisfied with `Ammar's statement?' "" Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with `Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, ""Haven't you heard the statement of `Ammar to `Umar? He said, ""Allah's Apostle sent you and me out and I became Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Allah's Apostle I told him about it and he said, 'This would have been sufficient,' passing his hands over his face and the backs of his hands once only.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Imran bin Husain Al-Khuza`i:                     Allah's Apostle saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, ""O so and so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?"" He replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! I am Junub and there is no water."" The Prophet said, ""Perform Tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Dhar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.' Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: ""Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, ""When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' The Prophet asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Idris."" The Prophet added, ""I passed by Moses and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Moses.' Then I passed by Jesus and he said, 'Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Jesus. Then I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham. The Prophet added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens."" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, ""Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, 'These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.' I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel took me till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundary) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     the mother of believers: Allah enjoined the prayer when He enjoined it, it was two rak`at only (in every prayer) both when in residence or on journey. Then the prayers offered on journey remained the same, but (the rak`at of) the prayers for non-travelers were increased."
Sarah,30," Narrated Um `Atiya:                     We were ordered to bring out our menstruating women and veiled women in the religious gatherings and invocation of Muslims on the two `Id festivals.

I greeted him. He asked, 'Who is she?' I replied, 'I am Um Hani bint Abi Talib.' He said, 'Welcome! O Um Hani.' When he finished his bath he stood up and prayed eight rak`at while wearing a single garment wrapped round his body and when he finished I said, 'O Allah's Apostle !

At that time, I was wearing a single garment with which I covered my shoulders and prayed by his side. When he finished the prayer, he asked, 'O Jabir! What has brought you here?' I told him what I wanted. When I finished, he asked, 'O Jabir! What is this garment which I have seen and with which you covered your shoulders?' I replied, 'It is a (tight) garment.' He said, 'If the garment is large enough, wrap it round the body (covering the shoulders) and if it is tight (too short) then use it as an Izar (tie it around your waist only.)' """
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl:                     The men used to pray with the Prophet with their Izars tied around their necks as boys used to do; therefore the Prophet told the women not to raise their heads till the men sat down straight (while praying).
Sarah,30," Narrated Mughira bin Shu`ba:                     Once I was traveling with the Prophet and he said, ""O Mughira! take this container of water."" I took it and Allah's Apostle went far away till he disappeared. He answered the call of nature and was wearing a Syrian cloak.

He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, 'Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.' He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, 'Muhammad (has come).' (Some of our companions added, ""With his army."")

He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraidha and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.' So the Prophet said, 'Bring him along with her.'

We requested him to stay for a meal called ""Khazira"" which we had prepared for him. Many members of our family gathered in the house and one of them said, ""Where is Malik bin Al-Dukhaishin or Ibn Al-Dukhshun?"" One of them replied, ""He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle."" Hearing that, Allah's Apostle said, ""Do not say so. Haven't you seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah' for Allah's sake only?"" He said, ""Allah and His Apostle know better. We have seen him helping and advising hypocrites."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire for those who say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah' for Allah's sake only."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet used to start every thing from the right (for good things) whenever it was possible in all his affairs; for example: in washing, combing or wearing shoes."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Um Habiba and Um Salama mentioned about a church they had seen in Ethiopia in which there were pictures.

They will be the worst creature in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     When the Prophet arrived Medina he dismounted at `Awali-i-Medina amongst a tribe called Banu `Amr bin `Auf. He stayed there For fourteen nights. Then he sent for Bani An-Najjar and they came armed with their swords. As if I am looking (just now) as the Prophet was sitting over his Rahila (Mount) with Abu Bakr riding behind him and all Banu An-Najjar around him till he dismounted at the courtyard of Abu Aiyub's house. The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, ""O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours."" They replied, ""No! By Allah! We do not demand its price except from Allah."" Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and he kept on saying, ""There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Allah! So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. """

Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month's journey. -2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum. Therefore my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due. -3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was not made so for anyone else). -4. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively but I have been sent to all mankind. -5.

A kite passed by that place, saw it Lying there and mistaking it for a piece of meat, flew away with it. Those people searched for it but they did not find it. So they accused me of stealing it and started searching me and even searched my private parts."" The slave girl further said, ""By Allah! while I was standing (in that state) with those people, the same kite passed by them and dropped the red scarf and it fell amongst them. I told them, 'This is what you accused me of and I was innocent and now this is it.' "" `Aisha added: That slave girl came to Allah's Apostle and embraced Islam. She had a tent or a small room with a low roof in the mosque. Whenever she called on me, she had a talk with me and whenever she sat with me, she would recite the following: ""The day of the scarf (band) was one of the wonders of our Lord, verily He rescued me from the disbelievers' town. `Aisha added: ""Once I asked her, 'What is the matter with you? Whenever you sit with me, you always recite these poetic verses.' On that she told me the whole story. """

Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     Allah's Apostle went to Fatima's house but did not find `Ali there. So he asked, ""Where is your cousin?"" She replied, ""There was something between us and he got angry with me and went out. He did not sleep (midday nap) in the house."" Allah's Apostle asked a person to look for him. That person came and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! He (Ali) is sleeping in the mosque."" Allah's Apostle went there and `Ali was lying. His upper body cover had fallen down to one side of his body and he was covered with dust. Allah's Apostle started cleaning the dust from him saying: ""Get up! O Aba Turab. Get up! O Aba Turab (literally means: O father of dust)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     I saw seventy of As-Suffa men and none of them had a Rida' (a garment covering the upper part of the body).

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle the mosque was built of adobes, its roof of the leaves of date-palms and its pillars of the stems of date-palms. Abu Bakr did not alter it. `Umar expanded it on the same pattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle by using adobes, leaves of date-palms and changing the pillars into wooden ones. `Uthman changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its walls with engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved stones and its roof of teak wood."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ikrima:                     Ibn `Abbas said to me and to his son `Ali, ""Go to Abu Sa`id and listen to what he narrates."" So we went and found him in a garden looking after it.

Her masters said, ""If you like, you can pay what remains (of the price of her manumission), (Sufyan the sub-narrator once said), or if you like you can manumit her, but her (inheritance) Al-Wala would be for us. ""When Allah's Apostle came, I spoke to him about it. He said, ""Buy her and manumit her. No doubt Al-Wala' is for the manumitted."" Then Allah's Apostle stood on the pulpit (or Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit as Sufyan once said), and said, ""What about some people who impose conditions which are not present in Allah's Book (Laws)?

I said to myself, ""Why is this Sheikh weeping, if Allah gave choice to one (of His) slaves either to choose this world or what is with Him in the Here after and he chose the latter?"" And that slave was Allah's Apostle himself. Abu Bakr knew more than us. The Prophet said, ""O Abu Bakr! Don't weep. The Prophet added: Abu- Bakr has favored me much with his property and company.

When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, ""Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook himself to Allah and so Allah accepted him and accommodated him; the second felt shy before Allah so Allah did the same for him and sheltered him in His Mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from Allah, and went away, so Allah turned His face from him likewise."

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) I had seen my parents following Islam since I attained the age of puberty. Not a day passed but the Prophet visited us, both in the mornings and evenings. My father Abu Bakr thought of building a mosque in the courtyard of his house and he did so. He used to pray and recite the Qur'an in it. The pagan women and their children used to stand by him and look at him with surprise. Abu Bakr was a Softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting the Qur'an. The chiefs of the Quraish pagans became afraid of that (i.e. that their children and women might be affected by the recitation of Qur'an)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The prayer offered in congregation is twenty five times more superior (in reward) to the prayer offered alone in one's house or in a business center, because if one performs ablution and does it perfectly, and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for each step which he takes towards the mosque, Allah upgrades him a degree in reward and (forgives) crosses out one sin till he enters the mosque. When he enters the mosque he is considered in prayer as long as he is waiting for the prayer and the angels keep on asking for Allah's forgiveness for him and they keep on saying: 'O Allah! Be Merciful to him, O Allah! Forgive him, as long as he keeps on sitting at his praying place and does not pass wind. (See Hadith No. 620)."

Sarah,30," Narrates Ibn Seereen:                     Abu Huraira said, ""Allah's Apostle led us in one of the two `Isha' prayers (Abu Huraira named that prayer but I forgot it)."" Abu Huraira added, ""He prayed two rak`at and then finished the prayer with Taslim. He stood up near a piece of wood Lying across the mosque and leaned on it in such a way as if he was angry. Then he put his right hand over the left and clasped his hands by interlacing his fingers and then put his J right cheek on the back of his left hand. The people who were in haste left the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them were Abu Bakr and `Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet. A long-handed man called Dhul- Yadain asked the Prophet, 'O Allah's Apostle! Have you forgotten or has the prayer been reduced?' The Prophet replied, 'I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced' The Prophet added, 'Is what Dhul Yadain has said true?' They (the people) said, 'Yes, it is true.' The Prophet stood up again and led the prayer, completing the remaining prayer, forgotten by him, and performed Taslim, and then said, 'Allahu Akbar.' And then he did a prostration as he used to prostrate or longer than that. He then raised his head saying, 'Allahu Akbar; he then again said, 'Allahu Akbar', and prostrated as he used to prostrate or longer than that. Then he raised his head and said, 'Allahu Akbar.' "" (The subnarrator added, ""I think that they asked (Ibn Seereen) whether the Prophet completed the prayer with Taslim. He replied, ""I heard that `Imran bin Husain had said, 'Then he (the Prophet) did Taslim."")"

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle came out on `Id day, he used to order that a Harba [??] (a short spear) to be planted in front of him (as a Sutra for his prayer) and then he used to pray facing it with the people behind him and used to do the same while on a journey. After the Prophet , this practice was adopted by the Muslim rulers (who followed his traditions)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aun bin Abi Juhaifa:                     I heard my father saying, ""The Prophet led us, and prayed a two-rak`at Zuhr prayer and then a tworak` at `Asr prayer at Al-Batha' [??] with a short spear (planted) in front of him (as a Sutra) while women and donkeys were passing in front of him (beyond that stick)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl (bin Sa`d):                     The distance between the Musalla of Allah's Apostle and the wall was just sufficient for a sheep to pass through .
Sarah,30, Narrated Salama:                     The distance between the wall of the mosque and the pulpit was hardly enough for a sheep to pass through.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     The Prophet used to get a Harba planted in front of him (as a Sutra) and pray behind it.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aun bin Abi Juhaifa:                     that he had heard his father saying, ""Allah's Apostle came to us at midday and water was brought for his ablution.

Sarah,30," Narrated Anas Ibn Malik:                     Whenever the Prophet went for answering the call of nature, I and another boy used to go after him with a staff, a stick or a short spear (or stick) and a tumbler of water and when he finished from answering the call of nature we would hand that tumbler of water to him."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Juhaifa:                     Allah's Apostle came out at midday and offered a two-rak`at Zuhr and `Asr prayers at Al-Batha and a short spear (or stick) was planted in front of him (as a Sutra). He performed ablution and the people took the remaining water left after his ablution and rubbed their bodies with it.
Sarah,30," Narrated Yazid bin Al `Ubaid:                     I used to accompany Salama bin Al-Akwa` and he used to pray behind the pillar which was near the place where the Qur'ans were kept. I said, ""O Abu Muslim! I see you always seeking to pray behind this pillar."" He replied, ""I saw Allah's Apostle always seeking to pray near that pillar."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     I saw the most famous people amongst the companions of the Prophet hurrying towards the pillars at the Maghrib prayer before the Prophet came for the prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet entered the Ka`ba along with Usama bin Zaid, `Uthman bin Talha and Bilal and remained there for a long time. When they came out, I was the first man to enter the Ka`ba. I asked Bilal ""Where did the Prophet pray?"" Bilal replied, ""Between the two front Pillars."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""Allah's Apostle entered the Ka`ba along with Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and `Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed the door and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came out, 'What did the Prophet do?' He replied, 'He offered prayer with one pillar to his left and one to his right and three behind.' In those days the Ka`ba was supported by six pillars."" Malik said: ""There were two pillars on his (the Prophet's) right side."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi':                      Whenever 'Abdullah entered the Ka'bah, he used to go ahead leaving the door of the Ka'bah behind him. He would proceed on till the remaining distance between him and the opposite wall about three cubits. Then he would off prayer there where the Prophet () had offered Salat, as Bilal informed me. Ibn 'Umar said, ""It does not matter for any of us to offer prayers at any place inside the Ka'bah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     ""The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and he would pray facing it (as a Sutra)."" I asked, ""What would the Prophet do if the she-camel was provoked and moved?"" He said, ""He would take its camel-saddle and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part (as a Sutra). And Ibn `Umar used to do the same."" (This indicates that one should not pray except behind a Sutra)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Do you make us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys? While I used to lie in my bed, the Prophet would come and pray facing the middle of the bed.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     The Prophet said, (what is ascribed to him in the following Hadith):Narrated Abu Salih As-Samman:I saw Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri praying on a Friday, behind something which acted as a Sutra. A young man from Bani Abi Mu'ait [??] , wanted to pass in front of him, but Abu Sa`id repulsed him with a push on his chest. Finding no alternative he again tried to pass but Abu Sa`id pushed him with a greater force. The young man abused Abu Sa`id and went to Marwan and lodged a complaint against Abu Sa`id and Abu Sa`id followed the young man to Marwan who asked him, ""O Abu Sa`id! What has happened between you and the son of your brother?"" Abu Sa`id said to him, ""I heard the Prophet saying, 'If anybody amongst you is praying behind something as a Sutra and somebody tries to pass in front of him, then he should repulse him and if he refuses, he should use force against him for he is a Shaitan (a Satan).'

Abu Juhaim replied, ""Allah's Apostle said, 'If the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would prefer to wait for 40 (days, months or years) rather than to pass in front of him."" Abu An-Nadr said, ""I do not remember exactly whether he said 40 days, months or years."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The things which annul the prayers were mentioned before me. They said, ""Prayer is annulled by a dog, a donkey and a woman (if they pass in front of the praying people)."" I said, ""You have made us (i.e. women) dogs. I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in my bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I would slip away. for I disliked to face him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet used to pray while I was sleeping across in his bed in front of him. Whenever he wanted to pray witr, he would wake me up and I would pray witr."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     the wife of the Prophet, ""I used to sleep in front of Allah's Apostle with my legs opposite his Qibla (facing him); and whenever he prostrated, he pushed my feet and I withdrew them and whenever he stood, I stretched them."" `Aisha added, ""In those days there were no lamps in the houses."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The things which annual prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, ""You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle used to get up at night and pray while I used to lie across between him and the Qibla on his family's bed.

Sarah,30, Narrated Maimuna bint Al-Harith:                     My bed was beside the praying place (Musalla) of the Prophet and sometimes his garment fell on me while I used to lie in my bed.
Sarah,30, Narrated Maimuna:                     The Prophet used to pray while I used to sleep beside him during my periods (menses) and in prostration his garment used to touch me.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     It is not good that you people have made us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys. No doubt I saw Allah's Apostle praying while I used to lie between him and the Qibla and when he wanted to prostrate, he pushed my legs and I withdrew them."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Maimun [??]:                     `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, ""While Allah's Apostle was praying beside the Ka`ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering. One of them said, 'Don't you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the Abdominal contents (intestines, etc.) of the slaughtered camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his shoulders?' The most unfortunate amongst them (`Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait) went (and brought them) and when Allah's Apostle prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their faces. When Allah's Apostle completed his prayer, he said, 'O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and added, 'O Allah! take revenge on `Amr bin Hisham, `Utba bin Rabi`a, Shaiba bin Rabi`a, Al-Walid bin `Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, `Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait and `Umar a bin Al-Walid."" `Abdullah added, ""By Allah!

Don't you know that once Gabriel came and offered the prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah's Apostle prayed too, then he prayed again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again he prayed (`Asr prayers and Allah's Apostle did the same; again he prayed (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and again prayed (`Isha prayer) and so did Allah's Apostle and (Gabriel) said, 'I was ordered to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'"" `Umar (bin `Abdul `Aziz) said to `Urwa, ""Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel lead Allah's Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?"" `Urwa replied, ""Bashir bin Abi Mas`ud narrated like this on the authority of his father."" `Urwa added, ""Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used to pray `Asr prayer when the sunshine was still inside her residence (during the early time of `Asr)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     ""Once a delegation of `Abdul Qais came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab'a [??] and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind (at home)."" The Prophet said, "" I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows): -1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and (Muhammad) am Allah's Apostle -2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times): -3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity) -4. To give me Khumus (The other four things which are forbidden are as follows): -1. Dubba -2. Hantam -3. Muqaiyat [??] -4.

I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said it.' `Umar said, 'No doubt you are bold.' I said, 'The afflictions caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is evil).' `Umar said, 'I did not mean that but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I (Hudhaifa) said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' `Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It will be broken.' `Umar said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' I was asked whether `Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Hadith that was free from any misstatement"" The subnarrator added that they deputized Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, ""The door was `Umar himself."""

And they or the Prophet used to offer the Fajr Prayers when it still dark."
Sarah,30, Narrated Salama:                     We used to pray the Maghrib prayer with the Prophet when the sun disappeared from the horizon.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     ""One night Allah's Apostle led us in the `Isha' prayer and that is the one called Al-`Atma [??] by the people. After the completion of the prayer, he faced us and said, ""Do you know the importance of this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight will be living after one hundred years from this night."" (See Hadith No. 575)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin `Amr:                     We asked Jabir bin `Abdullah about the prayers of the Prophet . He said, ""He used to pray Zuhr prayer at midday, the `Asr when the sun was still hot, and the Maghrib after sunset (at its stated time). The `Isha was offered early if the people gathered, and used to be delayed if their number was less; and the morning prayer was offered when it was still dark. """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle once delayed the `Isha' prayer and that was during the days when Islam still had not spread. The Prophet did not come out till `Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. Then he came out and said to the people of the mosque: ""None amongst the dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (`Isha prayer) except you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     My companions, who came with me in the boat and I landed at a place called Baqi [??] Buthan [??] . The Prophet was in Medina at that time. One of us used to go to the Prophet by turns every night at the time of the `Isha prayer. Once I along with my companions went to the Prophet and he was busy in some of his affairs, so the `Isha' prayer was delayed to the middle of the night He then came out and led the people (in prayer). After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there saying, ""Be patient! Don't go away. Have the glad tiding. It is from the blessing of Allah upon you that none amongst mankind has prayed at this time save you."" Or said, ""None except you has prayed at this time."" Abu Musa added, 'So we returned happily after what we heard from Allah's Apostle ."""

Then the Prophet came out and said, 'None amongst the dwellers of the earth has been waiting for it (the prayer) except you."" `Urwa said, ""Nowhere except in Medina the prayer used to be offered (in those days)."" He further said, ""The Prophet used to offer the `Isha' prayer in the period between the disappearance of the twilight and the end of the first third of the night."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Juraij from Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""Once Allah's Apostle was busy (at the time of the `Isha'), so the prayer was delayed so much so that we slept and woke up and slept and woke up again. The Prophet came out and said, 'None amongst the dwellers of the earth but you have been waiting for the prayer."" Ibn `Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the `Isha' prayer. Ibn Juraij said, ""I said to `Ata', 'I heard Ibn `Abbas saying: Once Allah's Apostle delayed the `Isha' prayer to such an extent that the people slept and got up and slept again and got up again. Then `Umar bin Al-Khattab I, stood up and reminded the Prophet I of the prayer.' `Ata' said, 'Ibn `Abbas said: The Prophet came out as if I was looking at him at this time, and water was trickling from his head and he was putting his hand on his head and then said, 'Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers, I would have ordered them to pray (`Isha' prayer) at this time.' I asked `Ata' for further information, how the Prophet had kept his hand on his head as he was told by Ibn `Abbas. `Ata' separated his fingers slightly and put their tips on the side of the head, brought the fingers downwards approximating them till the thumb touched the lobe of the ear at the side of the temple and the beard on the face. He neither slowed nor hurried in this action but he acted like that. The Prophet said: ""Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them to pray at this time."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet delayed the `Isha' prayer till midnight and then he offered the prayer and said, ""The people prayed and slept but you have been in prayer as long as you have been waiting for it (the prayer)."" Anas added: As if I am looking now at the glitter of the ring of the Prophet on that night."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah:                     We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, ""You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting (`Asr) you must do so.

The Prophet never missed them (two rak`at) after the `Asr prayer till he met Allah and he did not meet Allah till it became heavy for him to pray while standing so he used to offer most of the prayers while sitting. (She meant the two rak`at after `Asr) He used to pray them in the house and never prayed them in the mosque lest it might be hard for his followers and he loved what was easy for them ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Hisham's father:                     `Aisha (addressing me) said, ""O son of my sister! The Prophet never missed two prostrations (i.e. rak`at) after the `Asr prayer in my house."""

He said, 'I am afraid that you will sleep and miss the (Fajr) prayer.' Bilal said, 'I will make you get up.' So all slept and Bilal rested his back against his Rahila and he too was overwhelmed (by sleep) and slept. The Prophet got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, 'O Bilal! What about your statement?' He replied, 'I have never slept such a sleep.' The Prophet said, 'Allah captured your souls when He wished, and released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan for the prayer.' The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came up and became bright, he stood up and prayed."""

He said, ""He used to pray the Zuhr prayer, which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the `Asr at a time when one of US could go to his family at the farthest place in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the `Isha' late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 'Ayat' (verses) of the Qur'an in it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Qurra bin Khalid:                     Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized saying, ""Our neighbors invited us.""

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet prayed one of the `Isha' prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, ""Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night."" The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah's Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, ""Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night""; he meant ""When that century (people of that century) would pass away."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu `Uthman:                     `Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, ""The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, 'Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them' Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them."" `Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether `Abdur Rahman also said, 'My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the `Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr's wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' She said, 'They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused."" `Abdur Rahman added, ""I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, 'O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, 'That (oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered to pronounce Adhan for the prayer by saying its wordings twice, and for the Iqama (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when the people are ready for the prayer)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     When the Muslims arrived at Medina, they used to assemble for the prayer, and used to guess the time for it. During those days, the practice of Adhan for the prayers had not been introduced yet. Once they discussed this problem regarding the call for prayer. Some people suggested the use of a bell like the Christians, others proposed a trumpet like the horn used by the Jews, but `Umar was the first to suggest that a man should call (the people) for the prayer; so Allah's Apostle ordered Bilal to get up and pronounce the Adhan for prayers."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Bilal was ordered to repeat the wording of the Adhan for prayers twice, and to pronounce the wording of the Iqama once except ""Qad-qamat-is-salat""."
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others put forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Qilaba:                     Anas said, ""Bilal was ordered to pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of Iqama once only."" The sub narrator Isma`il said, ""I mentioned that to Aiyub and he added (to that), ""Except Iqama (i.e. Qadqamat- is-salat which should be said twice)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman:                     Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri told my father, ""I see you liking sheep and the wilderness. So whenever you are with your sheep or in the wilderness and you want to pronounce Adhan for the prayer raise your voice in doing so, for whoever hears the Adhan, whether a human being, a jinn or any other creature, will be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection."" Abu Sa`id added, ""I heard it (this narration) from Allah's Apostle."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Humaid:                     Anas bin Malik said, ""Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight (in Allah's cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack them."" Anas added, ""We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the Prophet. The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and when they saw the Prophet they shouted 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and his army.' When Allah's Apostle saw them, he said, ""Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned."""

Sarah,30," Narrated `Isa bin Talha:                     that he had heard Muawiya repeating the words of Adhan up to ""Wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasulul-lah (and I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Yahya as above (586) and added:                     ""Some of my companions told me that Hisham had said, ""When the Mu'adh-dhin said, ""Haiyi `alassala (come for the prayer).""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If the people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in the first row (in congregational prayers) and found no other way to get that except by drawing lots they would draw lots, and if they knew the reward of the Zuhr prayer (in the early moments of its stated time) they would race for it (go early) and if they knew the reward of `Isha' and Fajr (morning) prayers in congregation, they would come to offer them even if they had to crawl."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Al-Harith:                     Once on a rainy muddy day, Ibn `Abbas delivered a sermon in our presence and when the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan and said, ""Haiyi `ala-s-sala(t) (come for the prayer)"" Ibn `Abbas ordered him to say 'Pray at your homes.' The people began to look at each other (surprisingly). Ibn `Abbas said. ""It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet or his Mu'adh-dhin), and it is a license.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah:                     My father said that Allah s Apostle said, ""Bilal pronounces 'Adhan at night, so keep on eating and drinking (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces Adhan."" Salim added, ""He was a blind man who would not pronounce the Adhan unless he was told that the day had dawned."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Hafsa:                     When the Mu'adh-dhin pronounced the Adhan for Fajr prayer and the dawn became evident the Prophet ordered a two rak`at light prayer (Sunna) before the Iqama of the compulsory (congregational) prayer.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet used to offer two light rak`at between the Adhan and the Iqama of the Fajr prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Bilal pronounces the Adhan at night, so keep on eating and drinking (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces the Adhan."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     The Prophet said, ""The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not mean that dawn or morning has started."" Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas`ud imitated the gesture of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn) ."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet said, ""Bilal pronounces the Adhan at night, so eat and drink (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces the Adhan."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mughaffal Al-Muzani:                     Allah's Apostle said thrice, ""There is a prayer between the two Adhans (Adhan and Iqama),"" and added, ""For the one who wants to pray."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     ""When the Mu'adh-dhin pronounced the Adhan, some of the companions of the Prophet would proceed to the pillars of the mosque (for the prayer) till the Prophet arrived and in this way they used to pray two rak`at before the Maghrib prayer.

Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to pray two light rak`at before the morning (compulsory) prayer after the day dawned and the Mu'adh-dhin had finished his Adhan. He then would lie on his right side till the Mu'adh-dhin came to pronounce the Iqama.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mughaffal:                     The prophet said, ""There is a prayer between the two Adhans (Adhan and Iqama), there is a prayer between the two Adhans."" And then while saying it the third time he added, ""For the one who wants to (pray)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Malik bin Huwairith:                     I came to the Prophet with some men from my tribe and stayed with him for twenty nights. He was kind and merciful to us. When he realized our longing for our families, he said to us, ""Go back and stay with your families and teach them the religion, and offer the prayer and one of you should pronounce the Adhan for the prayer when its time is due and the oldest one amongst you should lead the prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Dhar:                     We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and the Mu'adh-dhin wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the (Zuhr) prayer. The Prophet said to him, ""Let it become cooler."" Then he again wanted to pronounce the Adhan but the Prophet; said to him, ""Let it become cooler.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Malik bin Huwairith:                     Two men came to the Prophet with the intention of a journey. The Prophet said, ""When (both of) you set out, pronounce Adhan and then Iqama and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Malik:                     We came to the Prophet and stayed with him for twenty days and nights. We were all young and of about the same age. The Prophet was very kind and merciful. When he realized our longing for our families, he asked about our homes and the people there and we told him. Then he asked us to go back to our families and stay with them and teach them (the religion) and to order them to do good things. He also mentioned some other things which I have (remembered or [??] ) forgotten. The Prophet then added, ""Pray as you have seen me praying and when it is the time for the prayer one of you should pronounce the Adhan and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."

Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle went out (of the mosque) when the Iqama had been pronounced and the rows straightened.

We kept on standing till the Prophet returned and the water was trickling from his head for he had taken a bath (of Janaba).
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Once Iqama was pronounced and the people had straightened the rows, Allah's Apostle went forward (to lead the prayer) but he was Junub, so he said, ""Remain in your places.""

By Him, in Whose Hands my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat present in between two ribs, he would have turned up for the `Isha' prayer.'"

And this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and his one sin is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his prayer, the angels keep on asking Allah's Blessings and Allah's forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musalla. They say, 'O Allah! Bestow Your blessings upon him, be Merciful and kind to him.' And one is regarded in prayer as long as one is waiting for the prayer."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""While a man was going on a way, he saw a thorny branch and removed it from the way and Allah became pleased by his action and forgave him for that."" Then the Prophet said, ""Five are martyrs: One who dies of plague, one who dies of an Abdominal disease, one who dies of drowning, one who is buried alive (and) dies and one who is killed in Allah's cause."" (The Prophet further said, ""If the people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in the first row (in the congregational prayer) and found no other way to get it except by drawing lots they would do so, and if they knew the reward of offering the Zuhr prayer early (in its stated time), they would race for it and if they knew the reward for `Isha' and Fajr prayers in congregation, they would attend them even if they were to crawl."

Mujahid said: ""Regarding Allah's Statement: ""We record that which they have sent before (them), and their traces"" (36.12). 'Their traces' means 'their steps.' "" And Anas said that the people of Bani Salima wanted to shift to a place near the Prophet but Allah's Apostle disliked the idea of leaving their houses uninhabited and said, ""Don't you think that you will get the reward for your footprints."" Mujahid said, ""Their foot prints mean their foot steps and their going on foot."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""No prayer is harder for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the `Isha' prayers and if they knew the reward for these prayers at their respective times, they would certainly present themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to c awl.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Allah will give shade, to seven, on the Day when there will be no shade but His. (These seven persons are) a just ruler, a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allah (i.e. worships Allah sincerely from childhood), a man whose heart is attached to the mosques (i.e. to pray the compulsory prayers in the mosque in congregation), two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake and they meet and part in Allah's cause only, a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for illicit intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah, a man who gives charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity), and a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Humaid:                     Anas was asked, ""Did Allah's Apostle wear a ring?"" He said, ""Yes.

Are there four rak`at in Fajr prayer?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     ""We were with `Aisha discussing the regularity of offering the prayer and dignifying it.

He was told that Abu Bakr was a softhearted man and would not be able to lead the prayer in his place. The Prophet gave the same order again but he was given the same reply. He gave the order for the third time and said, 'You (women) are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.' So Abu Bakr came out to lead the prayer. In the meantime the condition of the Prophet improved a bit and he came out with the help of two men one on each side. As if I was observing his legs dragging on the ground owing to the disease. Abu Bakr wanted to retreat but the Prophet beckoned him to remain at his place and the Prophet was brought till he sat beside Abu Bakr."" Al-A`mash was asked, ""Was the Prophet praying and Abu Bakr following him, and were the people following Abu Bakr in that prayer?"" Al- A`mash replied in the affirmative with a nod of his head.

The people began to look at one another with surprise as if they did not like it.

They lodged many complaints against Sa`d and even they alleged that he did not pray properly. `Umar sent for him and said, ""O Aba 'Is-haq! These people claim that you do not pray properly."" Abu 'Is-haq said, ""By Allah, I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah's Apostle and I never reduced anything of it. I used to prolong the first two rak`at of `Isha prayer and shorten the last two rak`at."" `Umar said, ""O Aba 'Is-haq, this was what I thought about you."" And then he sent one or more persons with him to Kufa so as to ask the people about him. So they went there and did not leave any mosque without asking about him. All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe of Bani `Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of Aba Sa`da stood up and said, ""As you have put us under an oath; I am bound to tell you that Sa`d never went himself with the army and never distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal verdicts."" (On hearing it) Sa`d said, ""I pray to Allah for three things: O Allah! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to trials."" (And so it happened). Later on when that person was asked how he was, he used to reply that he was an old man in trial as the result of Sa`d's curse. `Abdul Malik, the sub narrator, said that he had seen him afterwards and his eyebrows were overhanging his eyes owing to old age and he used to tease and assault the small girls in the way."
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Whoever does not recite Al-Fatiha in his prayer, his prayer is invalid."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle entered the mosque and a person followed him. The man prayed and went to the Prophet and greeted him. The Prophet returned the greeting and said to him, ""Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."" The man went back prayed in the same way as before, returned and greeted the Prophet who said, ""Go back and pray, for you have not prayed."" This happened thrice. The man said, ""By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I cannot offer the prayer in a better way than this. Please, teach me how to pray."" The Prophet said, ""When you stand for Prayer say Takbir and then recite from the Holy Qur'an (of what you know by heart) and then bow till you feel at ease. Then raise your head and stand up straight, then prostrate till you feel at ease during your prostration, then sit with calmness till you feel at ease (do not hurry) and do the same in all your prayers."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin Samura:                     Sa`d said, ""I used to pray with them a prayer similar to that of Allah's Apostle (the prayer of Zuhr and `Asr) reducing nothing from them. I used to prolong the first two rak`at and shorten the last two rak`at."" `Umar said to Sa`d ""This was what we thought about you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:                     My father said, ""The Prophet in Zuhr prayers used to recite Al-Fatiha along with two other Suras in the first two rak`at: a long one in the first rak`a and a shorter (Sura) in the second, and at times the verses were audible. In the `Asr prayer the Prophet used to recite Al-Fatiha and two more Suras in the first two rak`at and used to prolong the first rak`a. And he used to prolong the first rak`a of the Fajr prayer and shorten the second."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Ma`mar:                     I asked Khabbab whether the Prophet used to recite the Qur'an in the Zuhr and the `Asr prayers. He replied in the affirmative. We said, ""How did you come to know that?"" He said, ""From the movement of his beard."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam:                     Zaid bin Thabit said to me, ""Why do you recite very short Suras in the Maghrib prayer while I heard the Prophet reciting the longer of the two long Suras?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jubair bin Mut`im:                     My father said, ""I heard Allah's Apostle reciting ""at-Tur"" (52) in the Maghrib prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Rafi`:                     I offered the `Isha' prayer behind Abu Huraira and he recited, ""Idha s-samaa'u n-shaqqat"" (84) and prostrated.

He said, ""I prostrated behind Abul-Qasim, (the Prophet) (when he recited that Sura) and I will go on doing it till I meet him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     I heard the Prophet reciting wa t-teeni wa z-zaitun"" (95) in the `Isha' prayer, and I never heard a sweeter voice or a better way of recitation than that of the Prophet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin Samura:                     `Umar said to Sa`d, ""The people complained against you in everything, even in prayer."" Sa`d replied, ""Really I used to prolong the first two rak`at and shorten the last two and I will never shorten the prayer in which I follow Allah's Apostle."" `Umar said, ""You are telling the truth and that is what I think a tout you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:                     My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the stated times for the prayers. He replied, ""The Prophet used to offer the Zuhr prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon; the `Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in Medina (after praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). (The sub narrator said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer). The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the `Isha' prayer to the first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the rak`at."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Qur'an is recited in every prayer and in those prayers in which Allah's Apostle recited aloud for us, we recite aloud in the same prayers for you; and the prayers in which the Prophet recited quietly, we recite quietly. If you recite ""Al-Fatiha"" only it is sufficient but if you recite something else in addition, it is better."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq `Ukaz (market of `Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who asked them, ""What is wrong with you?"" They said, ""A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us."" They said, ""The thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven."" Those who went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq `Ukaz and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Qur'an they listened to it and said, ""By Allah, this is the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven."" They went to their people and said, ""O our people; verily we have heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which shows the true path; we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord."" Allah revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura 'Jinn') (72): ""Say: It has been revealed to me."" And what was revealed to him was the conversation of the Jinns."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet recited aloud in the prayers in which he was ordered to do so and quietly in the prayers in which he was ordered to do so. ""And your Lord is not forgetful."" ""Verily there was a good example for you in the ways of the Prophet."""
Sarah,30," Anas said:                      One of the Ansar used to lead the Ansar in Salat in the Quba' mosque and it was his habit to recite Qul Huwal-lahu Ahad whenever he wanted to recite something in Salat. When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, ""You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other."" He said, ""I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right ; otherwise I will leave you."" They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet () went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet () addressed him and said, ""O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do ? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a ?"" He repiled, ""I love this Surah."" The Prophet () said, ""Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wa'il:                     A man came to Ibn Mas`ud and said, ""I recited the Mufassal (Suras) at night in one rak`a."" Ibn Mas`ud said, ""This recitation is (too quick) like the recitation of poetry. I know the identical Suras which the Prophet used to recite in pairs."" Ibn Mas`ud then mentioned 20 Mufassal Suras including two Suras from the family of (i.e. those verses which begin with) Ha, Meem [??] (which the Prophet used to recite) in each rak`a."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:                     My father said, ""The Prophet uses to recite Al-Fatiha followed by another Sura in the first two rak`at of the prayer and used to recite only Al-Fatiha in the last two rak`at of the Zuhr prayer.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Ma`mar:                     We said to Khabbab ""Did Allah's Apostle used to recite in Zuhr and `Asr prayers?"" He replied in the affirmative. We said, ""How did you come to know about it?"" He said, ""By the movement of his beard."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If any one of you says, ""Amin"" and the angels in the heavens say ""Amin"" and the former coincides with the latter, all his past sins will be forgiven."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Say Amen when the Imam says 'Ghairi l-maghdubi `alaihim wala d-daalleen' (not the path of those who earn Your Anger (such as Jews) nor of those who go astray (such as Christians)); all the past sins of the person whose saying (of Amin) coincides with that of the angels, will be forgiven""."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakra:                     I reached the Prophet in the mosque while he was bowing in prayer and I too bowed before joining the row mentioned it to the Prophet and he said to me, ""May Allah increase your love for the good. But do not repeat it again (bowing in that way)."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Imran bin Husain:                     I offered the prayer with `Ali in Basra and he made us remember the prayer which we used to pray with Allah's Apostle. `Ali said Takbir on each rising and bowing.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Salama:                     When Abu Huraira led us in prayer he used to say Takbir on each bowing and rising. On the completion of the prayer he used to say, ""My prayer is more similar to the prayer of Allah's Apostle than that of anyone of you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Mutarrif bin `Abdullah:                     `Imran bin Husain and I offered the prayer behind `Ali bin Abi Talib. When `Ali prostrated, he said the Takbir, when he raised his head, he said the Takbir and when he got up for the third rak`a he said the Takbir. On completion of the prayer `Imran took my hand and said, ""This (i.e. `Ali) made me remember the prayer of Muhammad"" Or he said, ""He led us in a prayer like that of Muhammad."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ikrima:                     I saw a person praying at Muqam-Ibrahim (the place of Abraham by the Ka`ba) and he was saying Takbir on every bowing, rising, standing and sitting. I asked Ibn `Abbas (about this prayer). He admonished me saying: ""Isn't that the prayer of the Prophet?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ikrima:                     I prayed behind a Sheikh at Mecca and he said twenty two Takbirs (during the prayer). I told Ibn `Abbas that he (i.e. that Sheikh) was foolish. Ibn `Abbas admonished me and said, ""This is the tradition of Abul-Qasim."""
Sarah,30," And narrated Abu Huraira:                      Whenever Allah's Apostle stood for the prayer, he said Takbir on starting the prayer and then on bowing. On rising from bowing he said, ""Sami`a llahu liman hamidah,"" and then while standing straight he used to say, ""Rabbana laka-l hamd"" (Al- Laith said, ""(The Prophet said), 'Wa laka l-hamd'."" He used to say Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration; again he would Say Takbir on prostrating and raising his head. He would then do the same in the whole of the prayer till it was completed. On rising from the second rak`a (after sitting for at-Tahiyyat), he used to say Takbir."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mus`ab bin Sa`d:                     I offered prayer beside my father and approximated both my hands and placed them in between the knees.

Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Wahb:                     Hudhaifa saw a person who was not performing the bowing and prostration perfectly. He said to him, ""You have not prayed and if you should die you would die on a religion other than that of Muhammad."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     The bowing, the prostration the sitting in between the two prostrations and the standing after the bowing of the Prophet but not qiyam (standing in the prayer) and qu`ud (sitting in the prayer) used to be approximately equal (in duration)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Once the Prophet entered the mosque, a man came in, offered the prayer and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet returned his greeting and said to him, ""Go back and pray again for you have not prayed."" The man offered the prayer again, came back and greeted the Prophet. He said to him thrice, ""Go back and pray again for you have not prayed."" The man said, ""By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I do not know a better way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray."" He said, ""When you stand for the prayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur'an what you know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease, then rise from bowing till you stand straight. Afterwards prostrate calmly till you feel at ease and then raise (your head) and sit with Calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet used to say in his bowing and prostrations, ""Subhanaka l-lahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika; Allahumma ghfir li.' (Exalted [from unbecoming attributes] Are you O Allah our Lord, and by Your praise [do I exalt you]. O Allah! Forgive me)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     When the Prophet said, ""Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah,"" (Allah heard those who sent praises to Him), he would say, ""Rabbana wa laka l-hamd.""

A man behind him said, ""Rabbana wa laka l-hamdu, hamdan kathiran taiyiban mubarakan fihi"" (O our Lord! All the praises are for You, many good and blessed praises). When the Prophet completed the prayer, he asked, ""Who has said these words?"" The man replied, ""I."" The Prophet said, ""I saw over thirty angels competing to write it first."" Prophet rose (from bowing) and stood straight till all the vertebrae of his spinal column came to a natural position."
Sarah,30," Narrated Thabit:                     Anas used to demonstrate to us the prayer of the Prophet and while demonstrating, he used to raise his head from bowing and stand so long that we would say that he had forgotten (the prostration)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara':                     The bowing, the prostrations, the period of standing after bowing and the interval between the two prostrations of the Prophet used to be equal in duration ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aiyub:                     Abu Qilaba said, ""Malik bin Huwairith used to demonstrate to us the prayer of the Prophet at times other than that of the compulsory prayers. So (once) he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect Qiyam (standing and reciting from the Holy Qur'an) and then bowed and performed bowing perfectly; then he raised his head and stood straight for a while."" Abu Qilaba added, ""Malik bin Huwairith in that demonstration prayed like this Sheikh of ours, Abu Yazid."" Abu, Yazid used to sit (for a while) on raising his head from the second prostration before getting up."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakr bin `Abdur Rahman Ibn Harith bin Hisham and Abu Salama bin `Abdur Rahman:                     Abu Huraira used to say Takbir in all the prayers, compulsory and optional -- in the month of Ramadan or other months. He used to say Takbir on standing for prayer and on bowing; then he would say, ""Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah,"" and before prostrating he would say ""Rabbana wa laka lhamd."" Then he would say Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from the prostration, then another Takbir on prostrating (for the second time), and on raising his head from the prostration. He also would say the Takbir on standing from the second rak`a. He used to do the same in every rak`a till he completed the prayer. On completion of the prayer, he would say, ""By Him in Whose Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that of Allah's Apostle than yours, and this was His prayer till he left this world."""
Sarah,30," And Abu Huraira said, ""When Allah's Apostle raised his head from (bowing) he used to say ""Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa laka l-hamd."" He Would invoke Allah for some people by naming them:                      ""O Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and `Aiyash bin Abi Rabi`a and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers O Allah! Be hard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer from famine years like that of the time of Joseph."" In those days the Eastern section of the tribe of Mudar was against the Prophet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle fell from a horse and the right side of his body was injured. We went to inquire about his health meanwhile it was time for the prayer and he led the prayer sitting and we also prayed while sitting. On completion of the prayer he said, ""The Imam is to be followed; say Takbir when he says it; bow when he bows; rise when he rises and when he says ""Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah,"" say, ""Rabbana wa laka l-hamd"", and prostrate if he prostrates."" Sufyan narrated the same from Ma`mar. Ibn Juraij said that his (the Prophet's) right leg had been injured."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The people said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?"" He replied, ""Do you have any doubt in seeing the full moon on a clear (not cloudy) night?"" They replied, ""No, O Allah's Apostle!"" He said, ""Do you have any doubt in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?"" They replied in the negative. He said, ""You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, 'I am Your Lord.' They will say, 'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord.' Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, 'O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.' There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa'dan [??] in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa'dan [??]?"" The people said, ""Yes."" He said, ""These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa'dan [??] but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Allah will ask him, ""Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?' He will say, ""No by Your (Honor) Power!"" And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, 'Request more of such and such things.' Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say ""All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides."" Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, 'Allah's Apostle said, ""Allah said, 'That is for you and ten times more like it.' ""Abu Huraira said, ""I do not remember from Allah's Apostle except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides."" Abu Sa`id said, ""I heard him saying, 'That is for you and ten times more the like of it."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah bin Malik bin Buhaina:                     Whenever the Prophet used to offer prayer he used to keep arms away (from the body) so that the whiteness of his armpits was visible.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wail:                     Hudhaifa said, ""I saw a person not performing his bowing and prostrations perfectly. When he completed the prayer, I told him that he had not prayed."" I think that Hudhaifa added (i.e. said to the man), ""Had you died, you would have died on a tradition other than that of the Prophet Muhammad."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet was ordered (by Allah) to prostrate on seven parts and not to tuck up the clothes or hair (while praying). Those parts are: the forehead (along with the tip of nose), both hands, both knees, and (toes of) both feet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, ""We have been ordered to prostrates on seven bones and not to tuck up the clothes or hair."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib:                     (He was not a liar) We used to pray behind the Prophet and when he said, ""Sami`a l-lahu liman hamidah"", none of us would bend his back (to go for prostration) till the Prophet had placed his, forehead on the ground."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, ""I have been ordered to prostrate on seven bones i.e. on the forehead along with the tip of the nose and the Prophet pointed towards his nose, both hands, both knees and the toes of both feet and not to gather the clothes or the hair."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Salama:                     Once I went to Abu- Sa`id Al-Khudri and asked him, ""Won't you come with us to the date-palm trees to have a talk?"" So Abu Sa`id went out and I asked him, ""Tell me what you heard from the Prophet about the Night of Qadr."" Abu Sa`id replied, ""Once Allah's Apostle performed I`tikaf (seclusion) on the first ten days of the month of Ramadan and we did the same with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night you are looking for is ahead of you.' So the Prophet performed the I`tikaf in the middle (second) ten days of the month of Ramadan and we too performed I`tikaf with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night which you are looking for is ahead of you.' In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan the Prophet delivered a sermon saying, 'Whoever has performed I`tikaf with me should continue it. I have been shown the Night of ""Qadr"", but have forgotten its date, but it is in the odd nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was prostrating in mud and water.' In those days the roof of the mosque was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was clear and no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it rained. The Prophet led us in the prayer and I saw the traces of mud on the forehead and on the nose of Allah's Apostle. So it was the confirmation of that dream."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     The people used to pray with the Prophet tying their Izars around their necks because of their small sizes and the women were directed that they should not raise their heads from the prostrations till the men had sat straight.
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet was ordered to prostrate on seven bony parts and not to tuck up his clothes or hair.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, ""I have been ordered to prostrate on seven (bones) and not to tuck up the hair or garment."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet used to say frequently in his bowing and prostrations ""Subhanaka l-lahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika, Allahumma ghfir li"" (Exalted [from unbecoming attributes] Are you O Allah our Lord, and by Your praise [do I exalt you]. O Allah! Forgive me). In this way [??] he was acting on what was explained to him in the Holy Qur'an."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Qilaba:                     Once Malik bin Huwairith said to his friends, ""Shall I show you how Allah's Apostle used to offer his prayers?"" And it was not the time for any of the compulsory congregational prayers. So he stood up (for the prayer) bowed and said the Takbir, then he raised his head and remained standing for a while and then prostrated and raised his head for a while (sat up for a while). He prayed like our Sheikh `Amr Ibn Salama. (Aiyub said, ""The latter used to do a thing which I did not see the people doing i.e. he used to sit between the third and the fourth rak`a). Malik bin Huwairith said, ""We came to the Prophet (after embracing Islam) and stayed with him. He said to us, 'When you go back to your families, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and when there is the time for the prayer then only of you should pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara':                     The time taken by the Prophet in prostrations, bowing, and the sitting interval between the two prostrations was about the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Thabit:                     Anas said, ""I will leave no stone unturned in making you offer the prayer as I have seen the Prophet making us offer it."" Anas used to do a thing which I have not seen you doing. He used to stand after the bowing for such a long time that one would think that he had forgotten (the prostrations) and he used to sit in-between the prostrations so long that one would think that he had forgotten the second prostration."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet said, ""Be straight in the prostrations and none of you should put his forearms on the ground (in the prostration) like a dog."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Malik bin Huwairith Al-Laithi:                     I saw the Prophet praying and in the odd rak`at, he used to sit for a moment before getting up."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aiyub:                     Abu Qilaba said, ""Malik bin Huwairith came to us and led us in the prayer in this mosque of ours and said, 'I lead you in prayer but I do not want to offer the prayer but just to show you how Allah's Apostle performed his prayers."" I asked Abu Qilaba, ""How was the prayer of Malik bin Huwairith?"" He replied, ""Like the prayer of this Sheikh of ours-- i.e. `Amr bin Salima."" That Sheikh used to pronounce the Takbir perfectly and when he raised his head from the second prostration he would sit for a while and then support himself on the ground and get up."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Harith:                     Abu Sa`id led us in the prayer and said the Takbir aloud on arising from the prostration, and on prostrating, on rising again, and on getting up from the second rak`a. Abu Sa`id said, ""I saw the Prophet doing the same."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Mutarrif:                     `Imran and I prayed behind `Ali bin Abi Talib and he said Takbir on prostrating, on rising and on getting up after the two rak`at (i.e. after the second rak`a). When the prayer was finished, `Imran took me by the hand and said, ""He (`Ali) has prayed the prayer of Muhammad"" (or said, ""He made us remember the prayer of Muhammad)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abdullah:                     I saw `Abdullah bin `Umar crossing his legs while sitting in the prayer and I, a mere youngster in those days, did the same. Ibn `Umar forbade me to do so, and said, ""The proper way is to keep the right foot propped up and bend the left in the prayer."" I said questioningly, ""But you are doing so (crossing the legs)."" He said, ""My feet cannot bear my weight."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin `Amr bin `Ata':                     I was sitting with some of the companions of Allah's Apostle and we were discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi said, ""I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle better than any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders on saying the Takbir; and on bowing he placed his hands on both knees and bent his back straight, then he stood up straight from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In prostrations, he placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms away from the ground and away from his body, and his toes were facing the Qibla. On sitting In the second rak`a he sat on his left foot and propped up the right one; and in the last rak`a he pushed his left foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and sat over the buttocks."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Buhaina:                     (he was from the tribe of Uzd Shanu'a [??] and was the ally of the tribe of `Abdul-Manaf and was one of the companions of the Prophet): Once the Prophet led us in the Zuhr prayer and stood up after the second rak`a and did not sit down. The people stood up with him. When the prayer was about to end and the people were waiting for him to say the Taslim, he said Takbir while sitting and prostrated twice before saying the Taslim and then he said the Taslim."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Malik bin Buhaina:                     Once Allah's Apostle led us in the Zuhr prayer and got up (after the prostrations of the second rak`a) although he should have sat (for the Tashahhud). So at the end of the prayer, he prostrated twice while sitting (prostrations of Sahu)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:                     `Abdullah said, ""Whenever we prayed behind the Prophet we used to recite (in sitting) 'Peace be on Gabriel, Michael, peace be on so and so. Once Allah's Apostle looked back at us and said, 'Allah Himself is As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, at-Tahiyatu li l-lahi wa ssalawatu wa t-taiyibat. As-salamu `alalika aiyuha n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu l-lahi wa barakatuh. Assalamu `alaina wa `ala `ibadi l-lahi s-salihin. (All the compliments, prayers and good things are due to Allah; peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings [be on you]. Peace be on us an on the pious subjects of Allah). (If you say that, it will reach all the subjects in the heaven and the earth). Ash-hadu al-la ilaha illa l-lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan `Abduhu wa Rasuluh. (I testify that there is no Deity [worthy of worship] but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Apostle)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle used to invoke Allah in the prayer saying ""Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min `adhabi l-qabr, wa a`udhu bika min fitnati l-masihi d-dajjal, wa a`udhu bika min fitnati l-mahya wa fitnati l-mamat. Allahumma inni a`udhu bika mina l-ma'thami wa l-maghram. (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, from the afflictions of the imposter- Messiah, and from the afflictions of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sins and from debt)."" Somebody said to him, ""Why do you so frequently seek refuge with Allah from being in debt?"" The Prophet replied, ""A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks promises whenever he makes (them)."" `Aisha also narrated: I heard Allah's Apostle in his prayer seeking refuge with Allah from the afflictions of Ad-Dajjal."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakr As-Siddiq:                     I asked Allah's Apostle to teach me an invocation so that I may invoke Allah with it in my prayer. He told me to say, ""Allahumma inni zalumtu nafsi zulman kathiran, Wala yaghfiru dh-dhunuba illa anta, fa ghfir li maghfiratan min `indika, wa r-hamni, innaka anta l-ghafuru r-rahim (O Allah! I have done great injustice to myself and none except You forgives sins, so bestow on me a forgiveness from You, and Have Mercy on me, You are the Forgiver, the Merciful)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say, ""Peace be on Allah from His slaves and peace be on so and so."" The Prophet said, ""Don't say As-Salam be on Allah, for He Himself is As-Salam, but say, at-tahiyatu li l-lahi wa s-salawatu wa t-taiyibat. As-salamu `alaika aiyuha n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu l-lahi wa barakatuh. As-salamu `alaina wa `ala `ibadi l-lahi s-salihin. (If you say this then it will reach all the slaves in heaven or between heaven and earth). Ash-hadu al la-ilaha illa l-lah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan `Abduhu wa Rasuluh.' Then select the invocation you like best and recite it."" (See Hadith No. 794, 795 & 796)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     I saw Allah's Apostle prostrating in mud and water and saw the mark of mud on his forehead.
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle finished his prayers with Taslim, the women would get up and he would stay on for a while in his place before getting up. Ibn Shihab said, ""I think (and Allah knows better), that the purpose of his stay was that the women might leave before the men who had finished their prayer. """
Sarah,30, Narrated `Itban bin Malik:                     We prayed with the Prophet and used to finish our prayer with the Taslim along with him.
Sarah,30," Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi`:                     I remember Allah's Apostle and also the mouthful of water which he took from a bucket in our house and ejected (on me). I heard from `Itban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, ""I used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet and said to him, 'I have weak eyesight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe and I wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as a place for praying (mosque). He said, ""Allah willing, I shall do that."" Next day Allah's Apostle along with Abu Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gave him permission, but he didn't sit till he said to me, ""Where do you want me to pray in your house?"" I pointed to a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and we aligned behind him. He completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Ma`bad:                     (the freed slave of Ibn `Abbas) Ibn `Abbas told me, ""In the lifetime of the Prophet it was the custom to celebrate Allah's praises aloud after the compulsory congregational prayers."" Ibn `Abbas further said, ""When I heard the Dhikr, I would learn that the compulsory congregational prayer had ended."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I used to recognize the completion of the prayer of the Prophet by hearing Takbir.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Some poor people came to the Prophet and said, ""The wealthy people will get higher grades and will have permanent enjoyment and they pray like us and fast as we do. They have more money by which they perform the Hajj, and `Umra; fight and struggle in Allah's Cause and give in charity."" The Prophet said, ""Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say ""Subhana l-lah"", ""Al hamdu li l-lah"" and ""Allahu Akbar"" thirty three times each after every (compulsory) prayer."" We differed and some of us said that we should say, ""Subhan-al-lah"" thirty three times and ""Al hamdu li l-lah"" thirty three times and ""Allahu Akbar"" thirty four times. I went to the Prophet who said, ""Say, ""Subhan-al-lah"" and ""Al hamdu li l-lah"" and ""Allahu Akbar"" all together [??], thirty three times."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Warrad:                     (the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in a letter addressed to Muawiya that the Prophet used to say after every compulsory prayer, ""La ilaha illa l-lahu wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahu l-mulku wa lahu l-hamdu, wa huwa `ala kulli shay'in qadir. Allahumma la mani`a lima a`taita, wa la mu`tiya lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi minka l-jadd. [There is no Deity but Allah, Alone, no Partner to Him. His is the Kingdom and all praise, and Omnipotent is he. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you gave, nobody can give what You held back, and no struggler's effort can benefit against You]."" And Al-Hasan said, ""Al-jadd' means prosperity [??]."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Samura bin Jundub:                     The Prophet used to face us on completion of the prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:                     The Prophet led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, ""Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)?"" The people replied, ""Allah and His Apostle know better."" He said, ""Allah has said, 'In this morning some of my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Once the Prophet delayed the `Isha' prayer until midnight and then came to us. Having prayed he faced us and said, ""The people had prayed and slept but you were in the prayer as long as you were waiting for it."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Nafi:                      Ibn Umar used to offer prayers (Nawafil) at the place where he had offered the compulsory prayer. Al-Qasim (bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr) did the same. The narration coming from Abu Hurairah (from the Prophet ()) forbidding the Imam from offering prayers (optional prayer) at the same place where he was offered the compulsory prayer is incorrect.
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     ""The Prophet after finishing the prayer with Taslim used to stay at his place for a while."" Ibn Shihab said, ""I think (and Allah knows better), that he used to wait for the departure of the women who had prayed."" Ibn Shihab wrote that he had heard it from Hind bint Al-Harith Al-Firasiya from Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Hind was from the companions of Um Salama) who said, ""When the Prophet finished the prayer with Taslim, the women would depart and enter their houses before Allah's Apostle departed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba:                     I offered the `Asr prayer behind the Prophet at Medina. When he had finished the prayer with Taslim, he got up hurriedly and went out by crossing the rows of the people to one of the dwellings of his wives. The people got scared at his speed . The Prophet came back and found the people surprised at his haste and said to them, ""I remembered a piece of gold Lying in my house and I did not like it to divert my attention from Allah's worship, so I have ordered it to be distributed (in charity)."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     You should not give away a part of your prayer to Satan by thinking that it is necessary to depart (after finishing the prayer) from one's right side only; I have seen the Prophet often leave from the left side.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     During the holy battle of Khaibar the Prophet said, ""Whoever ate from this plant (i.e. garlic) should not enter our mosque."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ata':                     I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah saying, ""The Prophet said, 'Whoever eats (from) this plant (he meant garlic) should keep away from our mosque."" I said, ""What does he mean by that?"" He replied, ""I think he means only raw garlic."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from our mosque or should remain in his house."" (Jabir bin `Abdullah, in another narration said, ""Once a big pot containing cooked vegetables was brought. On finding unpleasant smell coming from it, the Prophet asked, 'What is in it?' He was told all the names of the vegetables that were in it. The Prophet ordered that it should be brought near to some of his companions who were with him. When the Prophet saw it he disliked to eat it and said, 'Eat. (I don't eat) for I converse with those whom you don't converse with (i.e. the angels)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdul `Aziz:                     A man asked Anas, ""What did you hear from the Prophet about garlic?"" He said, ""The Prophet said, 'Whoever has eaten this plant should neither come near us nor pray with us."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sulaiman Ash-Shaibani:                     I heard Ash-Shu`bi saying, ""A person who was accompanying the Prophet passed by a grave that was separated from the other graves told me that the Prophet once led the people in the (funeral) prayer and the people had aligned behind him. I said, ""O Aba `Amr! Who told you about it?"" He said, ""Ibn `Abbas."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""Ghusl (taking a bath) on Friday is compulsory for every Muslim reaching the age of puberty."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet slept (too). He got up (for prayer) in the last hours of the night and performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. (`Amr, the sub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he stood up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right and prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I heard his breath sounds till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and prayed without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said: We said to `Amr, ""Some people say, 'The eyes of the Prophet sleep but his heart never sleeps.' "" `Amr said, ""'Ubai bin `Umar said, 'The dreams of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son), I have seen in dream that I was slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice)."") (37.102)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     My grandmother Mulaika invited Allah's Apostle for a meal which she had prepared specially for him. He ate some of it and said, ""Get up. I shall lead you in the prayer."" I brought a mat that had become black owing to excessive use and I sprinkled water on it. Allah's Apostle stood on it and prayed two rak`at; and the orphan was with me (in the first row), and the old lady stood behind us."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once I came riding a she-ass and I, then, had just attained the age of puberty. Allah's Apostle was leading the people in prayer at Mina facing no wall. I passed in front of the row and let loose the sheass for grazing and joined the row and no one objected to my deed."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Once Allah's Apostle delayed the `Isha' prayer till `Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. Then Allah's Apostle came out and said: ""None from amongst the dwellers of earth have prayed this prayer except you."" In those days none but the people of Medina prayed."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur Rahman bin `Abis:                     A person asked Ibn `Abbas, ""Have you ever presented yourself at the (`Id) prayer with Allah's Apostle?"" He replied, ""Yes."" And had it not been for my kinship (position) with the Prophet it would not have been possible for me to do so (for he was too young). The Prophet went to the mark near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt and delivered a sermon. He then went towards the women. He advised and reminded them and asked them to give alms. So the woman would bring her hand near her neck and take off her necklace and put it in the garment of Bilal. Then the Prophet and Bilal came to the house."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Once Allah's Apostle delayed the `Isha' prayer till `Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. The Prophet came out and said, ""None except you from amongst the dwellers of earth is waiting for this prayer."" In those days, there was no prayer except in Medina and they used to pray the `Isha' prayer between the disappearance of the twilight and the first third of the night."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""If your women ask permission to go to the mosque at night, allow them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     (the wife of the Prophet) In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle the women used to get up when they finished their compulsory prayers with Taslim. The Prophet and the men would stay on at their places as long as Allah will. When the Prophet got up, the men would then get up."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     When Allah's Apostle finished the Fajr prayer, the women would leave covered in their sheets and were not recognized owing to the darkness."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada Al-Ansari:                     My father said, ""Allah's Apostle said, ""Whenever I stand for prayer, I want to prolong it but on hearing the cries of a child, I would shorten it as I dislike to put its mother in trouble."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Had Allah's Apostle known what the women were doing, he would have forbidden them from going to the mosque as the women of Bani Israel had been forbidden. Yahya bin Sa`id (a sub-narrator) asked `Amra (another sub-narrator), ""Were the women of Bani Israel forbidden?"" She replied ""Yes."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle completed the prayer with Taslim, the women used to get up immediately and Allah's Apostle would remain at his place for someone before getting up. (The sub-narrator (Az- Zuhri) said, ""We think, and Allah knows better, that he did so, so that the women might leave before men could get in touch with them)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet prayed in the house of Um Sulaim; and I, along with an orphan stood behind him while Um Sulaim (stood) behind us."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to offer the Fajr prayer when it was still dark and the believing women used to return (after finishing their prayer) and nobody could recognize them owing to darkness, or they could not recognize one another."

And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them but they differed about it.

He replied, ""I was busy and could not go back to my house till I heard the Adhan. I did not perform more than the ablution.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Tawus:                     I said to Ibn `Abbas, ""The people are narrating that the Prophet said, 'Take a bath on Friday and wash your heads (i.e. take a thorough bath) even though you were not Junub and use perfume'."" On that Ibn `Abbas replied, ""I know about the bath, (i.e. it is essential) but I do not know about the perfume (i.e. whether it is essential or not.)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Tawus:                     Ibn `Abbas mentioned the statement of the Prophet regarding the taking of a bath on Friday and then I asked him whether the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had ordered perfume or (hair) oil to be used if they could be found in one's house. He (Ibn `Abbas) replied that he did not know about it.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the Mosque and said to Allah's Apostle, ""I wish you would buy this to wear on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations."" Allah's Apostle replied, ""This will be worn by a person who will have no share (reward) in the Hereafter."" Later on similar cloaks were given to Allah's Apostle and he gave one of them to `Umar bin Al-Khattab. On that `Umar said, ""O Allah's Apostle! You have given me this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such and such a remark.""

Ruzaiq was working on the land (i.e. farming) and there was a group of Sudanese people and some others with him; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila. Ibn Shihab wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead the Jumua prayer and telling him that Salim told him that `Abdullah bin `Umar had said, ""I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care. The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house and is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master's belongings and is responsible for them.'

(The man did so). But the people disliked it. Ibn `Abbas said, ""It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) The people used to come from their abodes and from Al-`Awali (i.e. outskirts of Medina up to a distance of four miles or more from Medina). They used to pass through dust and used to be drenched with sweat and covered with dust; so sweat used to trickle from them. One of them came to Allah's Apostle who was in my house. The Prophet said to him, ""I wish that you keep yourself clean on this day of yours (i.e. take a bath)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Yahya bin Sa`id:                     I asked `Amra about taking a bath on Fridays.

Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet used to offer the prayer earlier if it was very cold; and if it was very hot he used to delay the prayer, i.e. the Jumua prayer."

Sarah,30," Narrated As-Saib bin Yazid:                     In the lifetime of the Prophet, Abu Bakr and `Umar, the Adhan for the Jumua prayer used to be pronounced when the Imam sat on the pulpit. But during the Caliphate of `Uthman when the Muslims increased in number, a third Adhan at Az-Zaura' was added. Abu `Abdullah said, ""Az-Zaura' is a place in the market of Medina."""
Sarah,30, Narrated As-Saib bin Yazid:                     The person who increased the number of Adhans for the Jumua prayers to three was `Uthman bin `Affan and it was when the number of the (Muslim) people of Medina had increased. In the lifetime of the Prophet there was only one Mu'adh-dhin and the Adhan used to be pronounced only after the Imam had taken his seat (i.e. on the pulpit).
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Umama bin Sahl bin Hunaif:                     I heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (repeating the statements of the Adhan) while he was sitting on the pulpit.

And when the Mu'adh-dhin said, ""Ash-hadu an la ilaha illal-lah (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)"", Muawiya said, ""And (so do) I"". When he said, ""Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah"" (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle), Muawiya said, ""And (so do) I"". When the Adhan was finished, Muawiya said, ""O people, when the Mu'adh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I heard Allah's Apostle on this very pulpit saying what you have just heard me saying""."
Sarah,30, Narrated As-Sa'ib bin Yazid I:                     `Uthman bin `Affan introduced the second Adhan on Fridays when the number of the people in the mosque increased. Previously the Adhan on Fridays used to be pronounced only after the Imam had taken his seat (on the pulpit).
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zuhri:                     I heard As-Saib bin Yazid, saying, ""In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, and Abu Bakr and `Umar, the Adhan for the Jumua prayer used to be pronounced after the Imam had taken his seat on the pulpit. But when the people increased in number during the caliphate of `Uthman, he introduced a third Adhan (on Friday for the Jumua prayer) and it was pronounced at Az-Zaura' and that new state of affairs remained so in the succeeding years."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Hazim bin Dinar:                     Some people went to Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi and told him that they had different opinions regarding the wood of the pulpit. They asked him about it and he said, ""By Allah, I know of what wood the pulpit was made, and no doubt I saw it on the very first day when Allah's Apostle took his seat on it. Allah's Apostle sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, 'Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.' So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Allah's Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Allah's Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, 'I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray.' """
Sarah,30, Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet used to stand by a stem of a date-palm tree (while delivering a sermon). When the pulpit was placed for him we heard that stem crying like a pregnant she-camel till the Prophet got down from the pulpit and placed his hand over it.
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     My father said , ""I heard the Prophet delivering the Khutba on the pulpit and he said, 'Whoever comes for the Jumua prayer should take a bath (before coming).' """

I asked her, 'What is wrong with the people ?' She pointed towards the sky with her head. I asked her, 'Is there a sign ?' 'Aishah nodded with her head meaning 'Yes'."" Asma' added, ""Allah's Messenger () prolonged the Salat to such an extent that I fainted. There was a waterskin by my side and I opened it and poured some water on my head. When Allah's Messenger () finished Salat, and the solar eclipse had cleared, the Prophet () addressed the people and praised Allah as He deserves and said, 'Amma ba'du'."" Asma' further said, ""Some Ansari women started talking, so I turned to them in order to make them quiet. I asked 'Aishah what the Prophet () had said. 'Aishah said: 'He said, 'I have seen things at this place of mine which were never shown to me before; (I have seen) even Paradise and Hell. And, no doubt it has been revealed to me that you (people) will be put in trial in your graves like or nearly like the trial of Masih Ad-Dajjal. (The angels) will come to everyone of you and ask him, 'What do you know about this man (Prophet Muhammad ()) ?"" The faithful believer or firm believer (Hisham was in doubt which word the Prophet () used), will say, 'He is Allah's Messenger () and he is Muhammad () who came to us with clear evidences and guidance. So we believed him, accepted his teachings and followed and trusted his teaching.' Then the angels will tell him to sleep (in peace) as they have come to know that he was a believer. But the hypocrite or a doubtful person (Hisham is not sure as to which word the Prophet () used), will be asked what he knew about this man (Prophet Muhammed ()). He will say, 'I do not know but I heard the people saying something (about him) so I said the same' "" Hisham added, ""Fatima told me that she remembered that narration completely by heart except that she said about the hypocrite or a doubtful person that he will be punished severely."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Taghlib:                     Some property or something was brought to Allah's Apostle and he distributed it. He gave to some men and ignored the others. Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he glorified and praised Allah and said, ""Amma ba'du. By Allah, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-content with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and `Amr bin Taghlib is one of them."" `Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah's Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Once in the middle of the night Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Allah's Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited ""Tashah-hud"" (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said, ""Amma ba'du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud) might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Hummaid As-Sa`idi:                     One night Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) stood up after the prayer and recited ""Tashah-hud"" and then praised Allah as He deserved and said, ""Amma ba'du."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:                     Once Allah's Apostle got up for delivering the Khutba and I heard him after ""Tashah-hud"" saying ""Amma ba'du."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once the Prophet ascended the pulpit and it was the last gathering in which he took part. He was covering his shoulder with a big cloak and binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified and praised Allah and said, ""O people! Come to me."" So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, ""Amma ba'du."" ""From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet used to deliver two Khutbas and sit in between them.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out (for Jumua prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the Khutba."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     A person entered the mosque while the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday. The Prophet said to him, ""Have you prayed?"" The man replied in the negative. The Prophet said, ""Get up and pray two rak`at."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     A man entered the Mosque while the Prophet was delivering the Khutba. The Prophet said to him, ""Have you prayed?"" The man replied in the negative. The Prophet said, ""Pray two rak`at."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man stood up and said, ""O, Allah's Apostle! The livestock and the sheep are dying, so pray to Allah for rain."" So he (the Prophet) raised both his hands and invoked Allah (for it)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Once in the lifetime of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) the people were afflicted with drought (famine). While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, ""O, Allah's Apostle! Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Allah (for rain)"". So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Allah (to protect us)"". So the Prophet raised both his hands and said, ""O Allah! Round about us and not on us"". So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina's (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about the abundant rain."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, ""When the Imam is delivering the Khutba, and you ask your companion to keep quiet and listen, then no doubt you have done an evil act."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) talked about Friday and said, ""There is an hour (opportune time) on Friday and if a Muslim gets it while praying and asks something from Allah, then Allah will definitely meet his demand."" And he (the Prophet) pointed out the shortness of that time with his hands."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     While we were praying (Jumua Khutba & prayer) with the Prophet (p.b.u.h), some camels loaded with food, arrived (from Sham). The people diverted their attention towards the camels (and left the mosque), and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet. So this verse was revealed: ""But when they see Some bargain or some amusement, They disperse headlong to it, And leave you standing."" (62.11)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle used to pray two rak`at before the Zuhr prayer and two rak`at after it. He also used to pray two rak`at after the Maghrib prayer in his house, and two rak`at after the `Isha' prayer. He never prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then he would pray two rak`at at home."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq (a kind of vegetable) on the edges of streams in her farm. On Fridays she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would give us that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look forward to Friday."

Sarah,30," Narrated Shu'aib:                     I asked Az-Zuhri, ""Did the Prophet ever offer the Fear Prayer?"" Az-Zuhri said, ""I was told by Salim that `Abdullah bin `Umar I had said, 'I took part in a holy battle with Allah's Apostle I in Najd. We faced the enemy and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) stood up to lead the prayer and one party stood to pray with him while the other faced the enemy. Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and the former party bowed and performed two prostrations. Then that party left and took the place of those who had not prayed. Allah's Apostle prayed one rak`a (with the latter) and performed two prostrations and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and performed two prostrations individually.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar said something similar to Mujahid's saying: Whenever (Muslims and non-Muslims) stand face to face in battle, the Muslims can pray while standing.

Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) led the fear prayer and the people stood behind him. He said Takbir (Allahu-Akbar) and the people said the same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he stood for the second rak`a and those who had prayed the first rak`a left and guarded their brothers. The second party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All the people were in prayer but they were guarding one another during the prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     On the day of the Khandaq `Umar came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said, ""O Allah's Apostle!

The 'Asr prayer became due for some of them on the way. Some of them decided not to offer the Salat but at Bani Quraiza while others decided to offer the Salat on the spot and said that the intention of the Prophet () was not what the former party had understood. And when that was told to the Prophet () he did not blame anyone of them."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) offered the Fajr prayer when it was still dark, then he rode and said, 'Allah Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. When we approach near to a nation, the most unfortunate is the morning of those who have been warned."" The people came out into the streets saying, ""Muhammad and his army."" Allah's Apostle vanquished them by force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she belonged to Allah's Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her manumission."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     `Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the `Id and when the delegations visit you."" Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) replied, ""This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter)."" After a long period Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to `Umar a cloak of silk brocade. `Umar came to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak."" Allah's Apostle said to him, ""Sell it and fulfill your needs by it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, ""Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?"" Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, ""Leave them."" When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signaled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of `Id, and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, ""Carry on! O Bani Arfida,"" till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, ""Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?"" I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara':                     I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) delivering a Khutba saying, ""The first thing to be done on this day (first day of `Id ul Adha) is to pray; and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in the name of Allah) and whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (traditions)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, ""Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Allah's Apostle !"" It happened on the `Id day and Allah's Apostle said, ""O Abu Bakr! There is an `Id for every nation and this is our `Id."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the `Id prayer, should slaughter again."" A man stood up and said, ""This is the day on which one has desire for meat,"" and he mentioned something about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same man added, ""I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep."" The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib:                     The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, ""Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Allah. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the `Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice."" Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the `Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer."" The Prophet said, ""The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk)."" He (Abu Burda) said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? ""The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr. When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, ""By Allah, you have changed (the Prophet's tradition)."" He replied, ""O Abu Sa`id! Gone is that which you know."" I said, ""By Allah! What I know is better than what I do not know."" Marwan said, ""People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer."""

Ata told me that Ibn `Abbas and Jabir bin `Abdullah, had said, ""There was no Adhan for the prayer of `Id-ul-Fitr and `Id-ul-Aqha."" `Ata' said, ""I heard Jabir bin `Abdullah saying, 'The Prophet stood up and started with the prayer, and after it he delivered the Khutba. When the Prophet of Allah (p.b.u.h) finished (the Khutba), he went to the women and preached to them, while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading his garment and the ladies were putting alms in it.' "" I said to Ata, ""Do you think it incumbent upon an Imam to go to the women and preach to them after finishing the prayer and Khutba?"" `Ata' said, ""No doubt it is incumbent on Imams to do so, and why should they not do so?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I offered the `Id prayer with Allah's Apostle, Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman and all of them offered the prayer before delivering the Khutba."

So anyone who does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, it was just meat which he presented to his family and would not be considered as Nusuk."" A person from the Ansar named Abu Burda bin Niyyar said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I slaughtered the Nusuk (before the prayer) but I have a young shegoat which is better than an older sheep."" The Prophet I said, ""Sacrifice it in lieu of the first, but it will be not sufficient (as a sacrifice) for anybody else after you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     I was with Ibn `Umar when a spear head pierced the sole of his foot and his foot stuck to the paddle of the saddle and I got down and pulled his foot out, and that happened in Mina.

So anyone who does so he acted according to our Sunna; and whoever slaughtered before the prayer then it was just meat that he offered to his family and would not be considered as a sacrifice in any way. My uncle Abu Burda bin Niyyar got up and said, ""O, Allah's Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep.""

Sarah,30," Al-Hasan bin Muslim told me thatIbn `Abbas had said, ""I joined the Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman in the `Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I came out (for the `Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse:                      'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).' After finishing the recitation he said, ""O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?"" None except one woman said, ""Yes."" Hasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet said, ""Then give alms."" Bilal spread his garment and said, ""Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies).""

She said, 'The husband of my sister took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and my sister was with her husband in six of them. My sister said that they used to nurse the sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! If a woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on `Id day)?' The Prophet said, 'Her companion should let her share her veil with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.' "" Hafsa added, ""When Um-`Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, 'Did you hear anything about so-and-so?' Um-`Atiya said, 'Yes, let my father be sacrificed for the Prophet (p.b.u.h).

Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara' bin `Azib:                     On the day of Nahr Allah's Apostle delivered the Khutba after the `Id prayer and said, ""Anyone who prayed like us and slaughtered the sacrifice like we did then he acted according to our (Nusuk) tradition of sacrificing, and whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, then that was just mutton (i.e. not sacrifice)."" Abu Burda bin Naiyar stood up and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! By Allah, I slaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eating and drinking (nonalcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors."" Allah's Apostle said, ""That was just mutton (not a sacrifice)."" Then Abu Burda said, ""I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a sacrifice for me?"" The Prophet replied, ""Yes. But it will not be sufficient for anyone else (as a sacrifice), after you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle offered the prayer on the day of Nahr and then delivered the Khutba and ordered that whoever had slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer should repeat it, that is, should slaughter another sacrifice. Then a person from the Ansar stood up and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! because of my neighbors (he described them as being very needy or poor) I slaughtered before the prayer. I have a young she-goat which, in my opinion, is better than two sheep."" The Prophet gave him the permission for slaughtering it as a sacrifice."

Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa on the authority of `Aisha:                     On the days of Mina, (11th, 12th, and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) Abu Bakr came to her while two young girls were beating the tambourine and the Prophet was lying covered with his clothes. Abu Bakr scolded them and the Prophet uncovered his face and said to Abu Bakr, ""Leave them, for these days are the days of `Id and the days of Mina."" `Aisha further said, ""Once the Prophet was screening me and I was watching the display of black slaves in the Mosque and (`Umar) scolded them.

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ibn Umar:                          Once a person asked Allah's Apostle about the night prayer. Allah's      Apostle replied, ""The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by     two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn      (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all      the Rakat which he has prayed before."""
Sarah,30," Nafi' told that 'Abdullah bin      'Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third)     odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain      matter (during that interval between the Rakat)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat ""Al-`Imran."" Allah's Apostle went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two rak`at five times and then ended his prayer with witr. He laid down till the Mu'adh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two rak`at (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer. (See Hadith No. 183, Vol. 1)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""Night prayer is offered as two rak`at followed by two rak`at and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one rak`a which will be witr for all the previous rak`at."" Al-Qasim said, ""Since we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a three-rak`at prayer as witr and all that is permissible. I hope there will be no harm in it."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to pray eleven rak`at at night and that was his night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah's Apostle raised his head. He also used to pray two rak`at (Sunna) before the (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him for the prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Seereen:                     I asked Ibn `Umar, ""What is your opinion about the two rak`at before the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in them?"" He said, ""The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two rak`at followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one rak`a witr. He used to offer two rak`at before the Fajr prayer immediately after the Adhan."" (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, ""That meant (that he prayed) quickly.)"""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle offered witr prayer at different nights at various hours extending (from the `Isha' prayer) up to the last hour of the night.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to offer his night prayer while I was sleeping across in his bed. Whenever he intended to offer the witr prayer, he used to wake me up and I would offer the witr prayer too."

I replied, ""I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted and prayed the witr prayer."" `Abdullah said, ""Isn't it sufficient for you to follow the good example of Allah's Apostle?"" I replied, ""Yes, by Allah."" He said, ""Allah's Apostle used to pray witr on the back of the camel (while on a journey)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet used to offer (Nawafil) prayers on his Rahila (mount) facing its direction by signals, but not the compulsory prayer. He also used to pray witr on his (mount) Rahila."
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin Seereen:                     Anas was asked, ""Did the Prophet recite Qunut in the Fajr prayer?"" Anas replied in the affirmative. He was further asked, ""Did he recite Qunut before bowing?"" Anas replied, ""He recited Qunut after bowing for some time (for one month)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Asim:                     I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, ""Definitely it was (recited)"". I asked, ""Before bowing or after it?"" Anas replied, ""Before bowing."" I added, ""So and so has told me that you had informed him that it had been after bowing."" Anas said, ""He told an untruth (i.e. ""was mistaken,"" according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah's Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month."" Anas added, ""The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Qur'an by heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between them and Allah's Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah's Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish them."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet recited Qunut for one month (in the Fajr prayer) asking Allah to punish the tribes of Ral and Dhakwan.
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     The Qunut used to be recited in the Maghrib and the Fajr prayers.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira;:                     Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the last rak`a he used to say: ""O Allah! Save `Aiyash bin Abi Rabi`a. O Allah! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Allah! Save Walid bin Walid. O Allah! Save the weak faithful believers. O Allah! Be hard on the tribes of Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of (Prophet) Joseph ."" The Prophet further said, ""Allah forgive the tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam."" Abu Az-Zinad (a sub-narrator) said, ""The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Masruq:                     We were with `Abdullah and he said, ""When the Prophet saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, ""O Allah! Send (famine) years on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet) Joseph."" So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, ""O Muhammad! You order people to obey Allah and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so please pray to Allah for them."" So Allah revealed: ""Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Mas`ud added, ""Al-Batsha (i.e. grasp) happened in the battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have all passed ."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Dinar:                     My father said, ""I heard Ibn `Umar reciting the poetic verses of Abu Talib: And a white (person) (i.e. the Prophet) who is requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows."" Salim's father (Ibn `Umar) said, ""The following poetic verse occurred to my mind while I was looking at the face of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he was praying for rain. He did not get down till the rain water flowed profusely from every roof-gutter: And a white (person) who is requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows . . . And these were the words of Abu Talib."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Whenever drought threatened them, `Umar bin Al-Khattab, used to ask Al-Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib to invoke Allah for rain. He used to say, ""O Allah!

He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second rak`a as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, ""The sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa."" The Prophet then said, ""O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira (selfrespect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh little and weep much."

He then did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first recitation. He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one and then said, ""Sami`a l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)"" and then prostrated and did the same in the second rak`a; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, ""The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer.""

Allah's Apostle after seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the affirmative). Then one day, Allah's Apostle rode to go to some place but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) prayer, and the people stood behind him.

They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah."" The people say, ""O Allah's Apostle! We saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating."" The Prophet replied, ""I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women."" The people asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why is it so?"" The Prophet replied, ""Because of their ungratefulness."" It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah.

If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, 'I have never had any good from you.' """

I said, 'Is there a sign?' She pointed out in the affirmative."" Asma' further said, ""I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Allah's Apostle had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Allah and said, 'I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma' said.) (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you know about this man (i.e. Muhammad). The believer or a firm believer (I do not know which word Asma' said) will reply, 'He is Muhammad, Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.' The angels will then say to him, 'Sleep peacefully as we knew surely that you were a firm believer.' The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do not know which word Asma' said) will say, 'I do not know. I heard the people saying something so I said it (the same).' """

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the mother of the faithful believers) Allah's Apostle (in his last days) used to pray sitting. He would recite while sitting, and when thirty or forty verses remained from the recitation he would get up and recite them while standing and then he would bow and prostrate. He used to do the same in the second rak`a. After finishing the Prayer he used to look at me and if I was awake he would talk to me and if I was asleep, he would lie down."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say: Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard.

(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them.

Sarah,30," Narrated Salim's father:                     In the lifetime of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah's Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the lifetime of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, ""I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire."" Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah's Apostle. The Prophet said, ""Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud."" After that `Abdullah (i.e. Salim's father) used to sleep but a little at night."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to offer eleven rak`at and that was his prayer.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to give up a good deed, although he loved to do it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I offer it."

I also saw as if two persons (i.e. angels) came to me and wanted to take me to Hell. Then an angel met us and told me not to be afraid. He then told them to leave me. Hafsa narrated one of my dreams to the Prophet and the Prophet said, ""Abdullah is a good man. Would that he offer the night prayer (Tahajjud)!"" So after that day `Abdullah (bin `Umar) started offering Tahajjud. The companions of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to tell him their dreams that (Laila-tul-Qadr) was on the 27th of the month of Ramadan.

Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to make the two rak`at before the Fajr prayer so light that I would wonder whether he recited Al-Fatiha (or not).
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to teach us the way of doing Istikhara (Istikhara means to ask Allah to guide one to the right sort of action concerning any job or a deed), in all matters as he taught us the Suras of the Qur'an. He said, ""If anyone of you thinks of doing any job he should offer a two rak`at prayer other than the compulsory ones and say (after the prayer): -- 'Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi'ilmika, Wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, Wa as'alaka min fadlika Al-`azlm Fa-innaka taqdiru Wala aqdiru, Wa ta'lamu Wala a'lamu, Wa anta 'allamu l-ghuyub.

You know and I do not and You know the unseen. O Allah! If You know that this job is good for my religion and my subsistence and in my Hereafter--(or said: If it is better for my present and later needs)--Then You ordain it for me and make it easy for me to get, And then bless me in it, and if You know that this job is harmful to me In my religion and subsistence and in the Hereafter--(or said: If it is worse for my present and later needs)--Then keep it away from me and let me be away from it.

Sarah,30," Narrated Marthad bin `Abdullah Al-Yazani:                     I went to `Uqba bin 'Amir Al-Juhani and said, ""Is it not surprising that Abi Tamim offers two rak`at before the Maghrib prayer?"" `Uqba said, ""We used to do so in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle."" I asked him, ""What prevents you from offering it now?"" He replied, ""Business."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-rabi' Al-Ansari:                     that he remembered Allah's Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard `Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah's Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, ""I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah's Apostle and said, 'I have weak eyesight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.' Allah's Apostle said, 'I will do so.' So Allah's Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah's Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, 'Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?' I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two rak`at, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called ""Khazir"" which I had prepared for him.--(""Khazir"" is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)-- When the neighbors got the news that Allah's Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, 'What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?' One of them replied, 'He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.' On that Allah's Apostle said, 'Don't say this. Haven't you seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah's sake only.' The man replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.' Allah's Apostle replied, 'No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell."" Mahmud added, ""I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Abu Aiyub, the companion of Allah's Apostle in the battle in which he (Abu Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu'awiya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, 'I doubt that Allah's Apostle ever said what you have said.' I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask `Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or `Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and `Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Offer some of your prayers in your houses and do not make them graves."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Quza'a:                          I heard Abu Said saying four words. He said, ""I heard the Prophet      (saying the following narrative)."" He had participated in twelve holy      battles with the Prophet."

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""One prayer in my Mosque is better than one thousand prayers in any other mosque excepting Al-Masjid-AI-Haram."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar never offered the Duha prayer except on two occasions: (1) Whenever he reached Mecca; and he always used to reach Mecca in the forenoon. He would perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba and then offer two rak`at at the rear of Maqam Ibrahim. (2) Whenever he visited Quba, for he used to visit it every Saturday. When he entered the Mosque, he disliked to leave it without offering a prayer. Ibn `Umar narrated that Allah's Apostle used to visit the Mosque of Quba (sometime) walking and (sometime) riding. And he (i.e. Ibn `Umar) used to say, ""I do only what my companions used to do and I don't forbid anybody to pray at any time during the day or night except that one should not intend to pray at sunrise or sunset."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Dinar:                     Ibn `Umar said, ""The Prophet used to go to the Mosque of Quba every Saturday (sometimes) walking and (sometimes) riding."" `Abdullah (Ibn `Umar) used to do the same."

Sarah,30," Narrated Qaza'a Maula:                     (freed slave of) Ziyad: I heard Abu Sa`id Al-khudri narrating four things from the Prophet and I appreciated them very much. He said, conveying the words of the Prophet. (1) ""A woman should not go on a two day journey except with her husband or a Dhi-Mahram. (2) No fasting is permissible on two days: `Id-ul-Fitr and `Id-ul-Adha. (3) No prayer after two prayers, i.e. after the Fajr prayer till the sunrises and after the `Asr prayer till the sun sets. (4) Do not prepare yourself for a journey except to three Mosques, i.e. Al-Masjid-AI-Haram, the Mosque of Aqsa (Jerusalem) and my Mosque."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn `Abbas:                     `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, ""I slept across the bed, and Allah's Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah's Apostle slept till midnight or slightly before or after it. Then Allah's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al `Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather watercontainer and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer."" `Abdullah bin `Abbas added, ""I got up and did the same as Allah's Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah's Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at, then two rak`at and then offered one rak`a witr. Then he lay down till the Mu'adh-dhin came and then he prayed two light rak`at and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to answer our greetings. When we returned from An-Najashi (the ruler of Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, ""In the prayer one is occupied (with a more serious matter)."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     The same as No. 290. from the Prophet.
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Arqam:                     In the lifetime of the Prophet we used to speak while praying, and one of us would tell his needs to his companions, till the verse, 'Guard strictly your prayers (2.238) was revealed. After that we were ordered to remain silent while praying."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of Bani `Amr bin `Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, ""The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the people in the prayer?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""Yes, if you wish."" So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 & 296)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Allah's Apostle heard it and said:--""Say, 'at-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu 'Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu warahmatu- l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-'ala 'ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `Abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah's mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worshipper of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The saying 'Sub Han Allah' is for men and clapping is for women."" (If something happens in the prayer, the men can invite the attention of the Imam by saying ""Sub Han Allah"". And women, by clapping their hands)."

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Anas bin Malik:                          While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a      Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the      curtain of 'Aisha's house, and looked at them as they were standing in     rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah's      Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the      Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to      see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their      prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The      Prophet expired on that very day."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          Allah's Apostle said, ""A woman called her son while he was in his      hermitage and said, 'O Juraij' He said, 'O Allah, my mother (is      calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?' She      again said, 'O Juraij!' He said again, 'O Allah ! My mother (is      calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?' She      again said, 'O Juraij' He again said, 'O Allah! My mother (is calling      me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)' She said, 'O      Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.' A     shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and      she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she     replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his      hermitage. Juraij said, 'Where is that woman who claims that her child     is from me?' (When she was brought to him along with the child),      Juraij asked the child, 'O Babus, who is your father?' The child      replied, 'The shepherd.' "" (See Hadith No 662. Vol 3)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mu'aiqib:                     The Prophet talked about a man leveling the earth on prostrating, and said, ""If you have to do so, then do it once."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     We used to pray with the Prophet in scorching heat, and if someone of us could not put his face on the earth (because of the heat) then he would spread his clothes and prostrate over them."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     I used to stretch my legs towards the Qibla of the Prophet while he was praying; whenever he prostrated he touched me, and I would withdraw my legs, and whenever he stood up, I would restretch my legs."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, ""Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:                     We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the Al-Haruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu`ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza Al-Aslami). A man from the Khawarij said, ""O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik."" And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, ""I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah's Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Once the sun eclipsed and Allah's Apostle stood up for the prayer and recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second rak`a and then said, ""These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in it I saw `Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet saw some sputum on the wall facing the Qibla of the mosque and became furious with the people of the mosque and said, ""During the prayer, Allah is in front of everyone of you and so he should not spit (or said, 'He should not expectorate')."" Then he got down and scratched the sputum with his hand. Ibn `Umar said (after narrating), ""If anyone of you has to spit during the prayer, he should spit to his left."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet said, ""Whenever anyone of you is in prayer, he is speaking in private to his Lord and so he should neither spit in front of him nor on his right side but to his left side under his left foot."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     The people used to offer the prayer with the Prophet with their waist-sheets tied round their necks because of the shortness of the sheets and the women were ordered not to lift their heads till the men had sat straight.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     I used to greet the Prophet while he was in prayer and he would return my greeting, but when we returned (from Ethiopia) I greeted the Prophet (while he was praying) but he did not return the greeting, and (after finishing the prayer) he said, ""In the prayer one is occupied (with a more serious matter)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     Allah's Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, 'Perhaps Allah's Apostle is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, ""The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying."" And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani `Amr bin `Auf at Quba reached Allah's Apostle and so he went to them along with some of his companions to affect a reconciliation. Allah's Apostle was delayed there and the time for the prayer became due. Bilal came to Abu Bakr! and said, ""O Abu Bakr! Allah's Apostle is detained (there) and the time for the prayer is due. Will you lead the people in prayer?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""Yes, if you wish."" So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah's Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and saw Allah's Apostle. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah's Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, ""O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, 'Sub Han Allah'."" Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, ""What prevented you from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     It was forbidden to keep the hands on the hips during the prayer. (This is narrated by Abu Huraira from the Prophet.)

He noticed the signs of astonishment on the faces of the people caused by his speed. He then said, ""I remembered while I was in my prayer that a piece of gold was Lying in my house and I disliked that it should remain with us throughout the night, and so I have ordered it to be distributed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When the Adhan for the prayer is pronounced, then Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the Mu'adh-dhin finishes, he comes back; and when the Iqama is pronounced he again takes to his heels and when it is finished, he again comes back and continues reminding the praying person of things that he used not to remember when not in prayer till he forgets how much he has prayed."" Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman said, ""If anyone of you has such a thing (forgetting the number of rak`at he has prayed) he should perform two prostrations of Sahu (i.e. forgetfulness) while sitting."" Abu Salama narrates this from Abu Huraira."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     People say that I narrate too many narrations of the Prophet; once I met a man (during the lifetime of the Prophet) and asked him, ""Which Sura did Allah's Apostle s recite yesterday in the `Isha' prayer?"" He said, ""I do not know."" I said, ""Did you not attend the prayer?"" He said, ""Yes, (I did)."" I said, ""I know. He recited such and such Sura."""

Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah bin Buhaina:                     Allah's Apostle got up after the second rak`a of the Zuhr prayer without sitting in between (the second and the third rak`at). When he finished the prayer he performed two prostrations (of Sahu) and then finished the prayer with Taslim.
Sarah,30," Narrated' `Abdullah:                     Once Allah's Apostle offered five rak`at in the Zuhr prayer, and somebody asked him whether there was some increase in the prayer. Allah's Apostle said, ""What is that?"" He said, ""You have offered five rak`at."" So Allah's Apostle performed two prostrations of Sahu after Taslim."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet led us in the `Asr or the Zuhr prayer and finished it with Taslim. Dhul-Yadain said to him, ""O Allah's Apostle! Has the prayer been reduced?"" The Prophet asked his companions in the affirmative. So Allah's Apostle I offered two more rak`at and then performed two prostrations (of Sahu). Sa`d said, ""I saw that 'Ursa bin Az-Zubair had offered two rak`at in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim. He then talked (and when he was informed about it) he completed the rest of his prayer and performed two prostrations, and said, 'The Prophet prayed like this.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira.:                     Once Allah's Apostle offered two rak`at and finished his prayer. So Dhul-Yadain asked him, ""Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""Has Dhul-Yadain spoken the truth?"" The people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up and offered the remaining two rak`at and performed Taslim, and then said Takbir and performed two prostrations like his usual prostrations, or a bit longer, and then got up."
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama bin 'Alqama:                     I asked Muhammad (bin Seereen) whether Tashah-hud should be recited after the two prostrations of Sahu. He replied, ""It is not (mentioned) in Abu Huraira's narration . """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet offered one of the evening prayers (the sub-narrator Muhammad said, ""I think that it was most probably the `Asr prayer"") and he finished it after offering two rak`at only. He then stood near a price of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and `Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, ""Has the prayer been reduced?"" A man who was called Dhul-Yadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), ""Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?"" He said, ""Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced."" He said, ""Certainly you have forgotten."" So the Prophet offered two more rak`at and performed Taslim and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Buhaina Al-Asdi:                     (the ally of Bani `Abdul Muttalib) Allah's Apostle stood up for the Zuhr prayer and he should have sat (after the second rak`a but he stood up for the third rak`a without sitting for Tashah-hud) and when he finished the prayer he performed two prostrations and said Takbir on each prostration while sitting, before ending (the prayer) with Taslim; and the people too performed the two prostrations with him instead of the sitting he forgot."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and say, ""Remember this and that (which he has not thought of before the prayer)"", till the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered three or four rak`at then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When anyone of you stands for the prayers, Satan comes and puts him in doubts till he forgets how many rak`at he has prayed. So if this happens to anyone of you, he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting."
Sarah,30," Narrated Kuraib:                     I was sent to Aisha by Ibn `Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and `Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two rak`at after the `Asr prayer and to say to her, ""We were informed that you offer those two rak`at and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them."" Ibn `Abbas said, ""I along with `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them."" I went to Aisha and told her that message. `Aisha said, ""Go and ask Um Salama about them."" So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to `Aisha. Um Salama replied, ""I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the `Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, 'Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two rak`at after the `Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them."" If he waves his hand then wait for him.' The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, ""O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two rak`at after the `Asr prayer.

Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah's Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, ""O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, 'Subhan-Allah' for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Abu Bakr!

He ordered (that he be taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the Prophet's) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). `Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear.

So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr).

Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, ""Do you testify that I am Allah's Apostle?"" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, ""I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates."" Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), ""Do you testify that I am Allah's Apostle?"" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, ""I believe in Allah and His Apostles."" Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), ""What do you think?"" Ibn Saiyad answered, ""True people and liars visit me."" The Prophet said, ""You have been confused as to this matter."" Then the Prophet said to him, ""I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)"" Ibn Saiyad said, ""It is Al-Dukh (the smoke)."" (2) The Prophet said, ""Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits."" On that `Umar, said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off."" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot overpower him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him."" (Ibn `Umar added): Later on Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka`b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw Allah's Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, ""O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad."" And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, ""Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     A young Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to embrace Islam.

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Shihab:                     The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, ""Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?"" Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: 'The pure Allah's Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.'

Allah's Apostle said to Abu Talib, ""O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and `Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, ""O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of `Abdul Muttalib?"" Allah's Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah') while they (Abu Jahl and `Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of `Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' (Then Allah's Apostle said, ""I will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so."" So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet once passed by two graves, and those two persons (in the graves) were being tortured. He said, ""They are being tortured not for a great thing (to avoid). One of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other was going about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends). He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you done so?"" He replied, ""I hope that their punishment may be lessened till they (the leaf) become dry."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali:                     "" We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The Prophet came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, ""There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched."" A man said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?"" The Prophet said, ""The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched."" Then he recited the Verses:-- ""As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. "" (92.5-6)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""Whoever intentionally swears falsely by a religion other than Islam, then he is what he has said, (e.g. if he says, 'If such thing is not true then I am a Jew,' he is really a Jew). And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell Fire."" Narrated Jundab the Prophet said, ""A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so Allah said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira-:                     The Prophet said, ""He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab:                     When `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was called upon to offer his funeral prayer. When Allah's Apostle stood up to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and such occasions?"" And started mentioning all that he had said. Allah's Apostle smiled and said, ""O `Umar! Go away from me."" When I talked too much he said, ""I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Allah's forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have done so."" (`Umar added): Allah's Apostle offered his funeral prayer and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' were revealed: i.e. ""And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)"" -- (`Umar added), ""Later I astonished at my daring before Allah's Apostle on that day. And Allah and His Apostle know better."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     A funeral procession passed and the people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, ""It has been affirmed to him."" Then another funeral procession passed and the people spoke badly of the deceased. The Prophet said, ""It has been affirmed to him"". `Umar bin Al-Khattab asked (Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ), ""What has been affirmed?"" He replied, ""You praised this, so Paradise has been affirmed to him; and you spoke badly of this, so Hell has been affirmed to him. You people are Allah's witnesses on earth."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:                     I came to Medina when an epidemic had broken out. While I was sitting with `Umar bin Al-Khattab a funeral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar said, ""It has been affirmed to him."" And another funeral procession passed by and the people praised the deceased. `Umar said, ""It has been affirmed to him."" A third (funeral procession) passed by and the people spoke badly of the deceased. He said, ""It has been affirmed to him."" I (Abu Al-Aswad) asked, ""O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?"" He replied, ""I said the same as the Prophet had said, that is: if four persons testify the piety of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Paradise."" We asked, ""If three persons testify his piety?"" He (the Prophet) replied, ""Even three."" Then we asked, ""If two?"" He replied, ""Even two."" We did not ask him regarding one witness."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib :                          The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""When a faithful believer is made to sit      in his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that none     has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's      Apostle. And that corresponds to Allah's statement: Allah will keep      firm those who believe with the word that stands firm . . . (14.27).      Narrated Shu'ba:     Same as above and added, ""Allah will keep firm those who believe . . .     (14.27) was revealed concerning the punishment of the grave."""

Somebody said to him, ""You are addressing dead people."" He replied, ""You do not hear better than they but they cannot reply."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet said, ""They now realize that what I used to tell them was the truth. ""And Allah said, 'Verily! You cannot make the dead to hear (i.e. benefit them, and similarly the disbelievers) nor can you make the deaf hear. (27.80)."

He said, ""Yes, (there is) punishment in the grave."" `Aisha added, ""After that I never saw Allah's Apostle but seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment in the grave in every prayer he prayed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:                     Allah's Apostle once stood up delivering a sermon and mentioned the trial which people will face in the grave. When he mentioned that, the Muslims started shouting loudly."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When (Allah's) slave is put in his grave and his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels come to him and make him sit and ask, 'What did you use to say about this man (i.e. Muhammad)?' The faithful Believer will say, 'I testify that he is Allah's slave and His Apostle.' Then they will say to him, 'Look at your place in the Hell Fire; Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead of it.' So he will see both his places."" (Qatada said, ""We were informed that his grave would be made spacious."" Then Qatada went back to the narration of Anas who said;) Whereas a hypocrite or a non-believer will be asked, ""What did you use to say about this man."" He will reply, ""I do not know; but I used to say what the people used to say."" So they will say to him, ""Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Qur'an)."" Then he will be hit with iron hammers once, that he will send such a cry as everything near to him will hear, except Jinns and human beings. (See Hadith No. 422)."

Do you find it mutilated?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Samura bin Jundab:                     Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, ""Who amongst you had a dream last night?"" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: ""Ma sha'a-llah"" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, 'What Allah wished,' and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, ""But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jawbone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the meantime the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Qur'an (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gatekeeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my place.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Hisham's father:                     Aisha said, ""I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She replied, 'In three Suhuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     A man said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), ""My mother died suddenly and I thought that if she had lived she would have given alms. So, if I give alms now on her behalf, will she get the reward?"" The Prophet replied in the affirmative."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     During his sickness, Allah's Apostle was asking repeatedly, ""Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?"" And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle in his fatal illness said, ""Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets."" And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet's grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Bakr bin `Aiyash:                     Sufyan at-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet elevated and convex.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin `Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No one could be found who could tell them about it till I (`Urwa) said to them, ""By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of `Umar."""
Sarah,30," Aisha narrated that she made a will to `Abdullah bin Zubair, ""Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:                     I saw `Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, ""O `Abdullah bin `Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions."" (So, Ibn `Umar conveyed the message to `Aisha.) She said, ""I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (`Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there)."" When `Abdullah bin `Umar returned, `Umar asked him, ""What (news) do you have?"" He replied, ""O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there)."" On that `Umar said, ""Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (`Aisha ) and say, `Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the graveyard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,"" and then he mentioned the name of `Uthman, `Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas. By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, ""O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah's glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this."" `Umar replied, ""O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities."""

Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind."" The Prophet said, ""I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay onefifth of the booty in Allah's Cause.

I would fight with them for withholding it"" Then `Umar said, ""By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah:                     I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet for offering prayer perfectly, giving Zakat, and giving good advice to every Muslim."

Sarah,30," Narrated Khalid bin Aslam:                      We went out with 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and bedouin said (to 'Abdullah), ""Tell me about Allah's saying: ""And those who hoard up gold and silver (Al-Kanz - money, gold, silver etc., the Zakat of which has not been paid) and spend it out in the Way of Allah (V.9:34)."" Ibn 'Umar said, ""Whoever hoarded them and did not pay the Zakat thereof, then woe to him. But these holy Verses were revealed before the Verses of Zakat. So when the Verses of Zakat were revealed Allah made Zakat a purifier of the property."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, ""No Zakat is due on property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs."" (A Wasqs equals 60 Sa's) & (1 Sa=3 K gms App.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Wahab:                     I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and asked him, ""What has brought you to this place?"" He said, ""I was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the Qur'an): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed regarding the people of the scriptures."" I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the scriptures."" So we had a quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a complaint against me to `Uthman. `Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to `Uthman who said to me, ""You may depart and live nearby if you wish."" That was the reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais:                     While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us and said, ""Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting."" After saying that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said to him, ""I think the people disliked what you had said."" He said, ""These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me."" I asked, ""Who is your friend?"" He said, ""The Prophet said (to me), 'O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?' And on that I (Abu Dhar) started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah's Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, 'Yes!' He said, 'I do not love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah's cause) except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth. No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic."" '"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Mas`ud:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""There is no envy except in two: a person whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a person whom Allah has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he gives his decisions accordingly and teaches it to the others."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If one give in charity what equals one date-fruit from the honestly earned money and Allah accepts only the honestly earned money --Allah takes it in His right (hand) and then enlarges its reward for that person (who has given it), as anyone of you brings up his baby horse, so much s that it becomes as big as a mountain"
Sarah,30," Narrated Haritha bin Wahab:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""O people! Give in charity as a time will come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested to take it) will say, ""If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken it, but today I am not in need of it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till your wealth increases so much so that one will be worried, for no one will accept his Zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, 'I am not in need of it.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Adi bin Hatim:                     While I was sitting with Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) two person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained about the prevalence of robberies. Allah's Apostle said, ""As regards stealing and robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina) without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask him, 'Did not I give you wealth?' He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further ask, 'Didn't send a messenger to you?' And again that person will reply in the affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if you do not find a hall datefruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     Thy Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""A time will come upon the people when a person will wander about with gold as Zakat and will not find anybody to accept it, and one man will be seen followed by forty women to be their guardian because of scarcity of men and great number of women. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Mas`ud:                     When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they (the people) said, ""He is showing off."" And another man came and gave a Sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, ""Allah is not in need of this small amount of charity."" And then the Divine Inspiration came: ""Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them."" (9.79)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered us to give in charity, we used to go to the market and work as porters and get a Mudd (a special measure of grain) and then give it in charity. (Those were the days of poverty) and today some of us have one hundred thousand."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Adi bin Hatim heard the Prophet saying:                     ""Save yourself from Hell-fire even by giving half a date-fruit in charity."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for some alms), but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and she divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything herself, and then she got up and went away. Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story. He said, ""Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously (with benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire."" (See Hadith No. 24, Vol. 8)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man came to the Prophet and asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Which charity is the most superior in reward?"" He replied, ""The charity which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, 'Give so much to such and such, and so much to such and such.' And it has already belonged to such and such (as it is too late)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, ""Who amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?"" He said, ""Whoever has the longest hand."" So they started measuring their hands with a stick and Sauda's hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of all in the caliphate of `Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, ""A man said that he would give something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object of charity to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, ""O Allah! All the praises are for you. I will give alms again."" And so he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress last night. The man said, ""O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. I will give alms again."" So he went out with his alms again and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next morning said that he had given his alms to a wealthy person. He said, ""O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man."" Then someone came and said to him, ""The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson from it and spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah's cause."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ma'n bin Yazid:                     My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. One day I went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had taken some gold coins for charity and kept them with a man in the mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and took them and brought them to him (my father). My father said, ""By Allah! I did not intend to give them to you. "" I took (the case) to Allah's Apostle . On that Allah's Apostle said, ""O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you intended. O Man! Whatever you have taken is yours."""

They are: (1) a just ruler; (2) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allah, (i.e. worship Allah (Alone) sincerely from his childhood), (3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosque (who offers the five compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque); (4) two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake and they meet and part in Allah's cause only; (5) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for an illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allah; (6) a person who practices charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given (i.e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity). (7) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes get flooded with tears."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Haritha bin Wahab Al-Khuza`i:                     I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, ""(O people!) Give in charity (for Allah's cause) because a time will come when a person will carry his object of charity from place to place (and he will not find any person to take it) and any person whom he shall request to take it, I will reply, 'If you had brought it yesterday I would have taken it, but today I am not in need of it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""When a woman gives in charity some of the foodstuff (which she has in her house) without spoiling it, she will receive the reward for what she has spent, and her husband will receive the reward because of his earning, and the storekeeper will also have a reward similar to it.

Sarah,30," Narrated Hakim bin Hizam:                     The Prophet said, ""The upper hand is better than the lower hand (i.e. he who gives in charity is better than him who takes it). One should start giving first to his dependents. And the best object of charity is that which is given by a wealthy person (from the money which is left after his expenses). And whoever abstains from asking others for some financial help, Allah will give him and save him from asking others, Allah will make him self-sufficient."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     I heard Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) while he was on the pulpit speaking about charity, to abstain from asking others for some financial help and about begging others, saying, ""The upper hand is better than the lower hand. The upper hand is that of the giver and the lower (hand) is that of the beggar."""

I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said it.' `Umar said, 'No doubt, you are bold. How did he say it?' I said, 'A man's afflictions (wrong deeds) concerning his wife, children and neighbors are expiated by (his) prayers, charity, and enjoining good.' (The sub-narrator Sulaiman added that he said, 'The prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.') `Umar said, 'I did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I said, 'O chief of the believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' He asked, 'Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'No, it will be broken.' He said, 'Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again?' I replied, 'Yes.' "" Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of a miser and an almsgiver is like the example of two persons wearing iron cloaks."" Allah's Apostle also said, ""The example of an almsgiver and a miser is like the example of two persons who have two iron cloaks on them from their breasts to their collar bones, and when the almsgiver wants to give in charity, the cloak becomes capacious till it covers his whole body to such an extent that it hides his fingertips and covers his footprints (obliterates his tracks).

Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah had instructed His Apostle (p.b.u.h) to do regarding the one who had to pay one Bint Makhad (i.e. one year-old she-camel) as Zakat, and he did not have it but had got Bint Labun (two year old she-camel). (He wrote that) it could be accepted from him as Zakat, and the collector of Zakat would return him 20 Dirhams or two sheep; and if the Zakat payer had not a Bint Makhad, but he had Ibn Labun (a two year old he-camel) then it could be accepted as his Zakat, but he would not be paid anything ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I am a witness that Allah's Apostle offered the Id prayer before delivering the sermon and then he thought that the women would not be able to hear him (because of the distance), so he went to them along with Bilal who was spreading his garment. The Prophet advised and ordered them to give in charity. So the women started giving their ornaments (in charity). (The sub-narrator Aiyub pointed towards his ears and neck meaning that they gave ornaments from those places such as earrings and necklaces.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Abu Bakr wrote to me what was made compulsory by Allah's Apostle and that was (regarding the payments of Zakat): Neither the property of different people may be taken together nor the joint property may be split for fear of (paying more, or receiving less) Zakat."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah's Apostle has made compulsory (regarding Zakat) and this was mentioned in it: If a property is equally owned by two partners, they should pay the combined Zakat and it will be considered that both of them have paid their Zakat equally."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     A Bedouin asked Allah's Apostle about the emigration. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""May Allah have mercy on you! The matter of emigration is very hard. Have you got camels? Do you pay their Zakat?"" The Bedouin said, ""Yes, I have camels and I pay their Zakat."" The Prophet said, Work beyond the seas and Allah will not decrease (waste) any of your good deeds."" (See Hadith No. 260 Vol. 5)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Abu Bakr , wrote to me about the Zakat which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever had to pay Jahda (Jahda means a four-year-old she-camel) as Zakat from his herd of camels and he had not got one, and he had Hiqqa (three-year-old she-camel), that Hiqqa should be accepted from him along with two sheep if they were available or twenty Dirhams (one Durham equals about 1/4 Saudi Riyal) and whoever had to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and he had no Hiqqa but had a Jadha, the Jadha should be accepted from him, and the Zakat collector should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay Hiqqa as Zakat and he had not got one, but had a Bint Labun (two-year-old she-camel), it should be accepted from him along with two sheep or twenty Dirhams; and whoever had to pay Bint Labun and had a Hiqqa, that Hiqqa should be accepted from him and the Zakat collector should repay him twenty Dirhams or two sheep; and whoever had to pay Bint Labun and he had not got one but had a Bint Makhad (one-year-old she camel), that Bint Makhad should be accepted from him along with twenty Dirhams or two sheep."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     When Abu Bakr; sent me to (collect the Zakat from) Bahrain, he wrote to me the following:-- (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful). These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah's Apostle had made obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to seventy-five (camels), one Jadha is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to one-hundredand twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but if the owner wants to pay he can.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Abu Bakr wrote to me what Allah had ordered His Apostle (about Zakat) which goes: Neither an old nor a defected animal, nor a male-goat may be taken as Zakat except if the Zakat collector wishes (to take it)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Abu Bakr said, ""By Allah! If they (pay me the Zakat and) withhold even a she-kid which they used to pay during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle, I will fight with them for it."" `Umar said, ""It was nothing but Allah Who opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, and I came to know that his decision was right."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     When Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said (to him), ""YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them to worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; and if they start offering these prayers, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them, the Zakat. And it is to be taken from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don't take) the best property of the people as Zakat."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""No Zakat is imposed on less than five Awsuq of dates; no Zakat is imposed on less than five Awaq of silver, and no Zakat is imposed on less than five camels."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Dhar:                     Once I went to him (the Prophet ) and he said, ""By Allah in Whose Hands my life is (or probably said, 'By Allah, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped) whoever had camels or cows or sheep and did not pay their Zakat, those animals will be brought on the Day of Resurrection far bigger and fatter than before and they will tread him under their hooves, and will butt him with their horns, and (those animals will come in circle): When the last does its turn, the first will start again, and this punishment will go on till Allah has finished the judgments amongst the people."""
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Is-haq bin `Abdullah bin Al Talha:                     I heard Anas bin Malik saying, ""Abu Talha had more property of date-palm trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the Mosque of the Prophet . Allah's Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water."" Anas added, ""When these verses were revealed:--'By no means shall you Attain righteousness unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. ' (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah's Apostle 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt, Bairuha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it where Allah makes you think it feasible.' On that Allah's Apostle said, 'Bravo! It is useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.' Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah's Apostle.' Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     On `Id ul Fitr or `Id ul Adha Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, ""O people! Give alms."" Then he went towards the women and said. ""O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)."" The women asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! What is the reason for it?"" He replied, ""O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray."" Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Mas`ud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, ""O Allah's Apostle! It is Zainab."" He asked, 'Which Zainab?"" The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, ""Yes, allow her to enter."" And she was admitted. Then she said, ""O Prophet of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Mas`ud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody else."" The Prophet replied, ""Ibn Mas`ud had spoken the truth. Your husband and your children had more right to it than anybody else."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There is no Zakat either on a horse or a slave belonging to a Muslim."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""There is no Zakat either on a slave or on a horse belonging to a Muslim."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him. Then he said, ""The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which will be disclosed to you."" Somebody said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Can the good bring forth evil?"" The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person, ""What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not talking to you."" Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, ""Where is the questioner?"" It seemed as if the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, ""Good never brings forth evil. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Al-Harith:                     Zainab, the wife of `Abdullah said, ""I was in the Mosque and saw the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your ornaments.' "" Zainab used to provide for `Abdullah and those orphans who were under her protection. So she said to `Abdullah, ""Will you ask Allah's Apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?"" He replied ""Will you yourself ask Allah's Apostle ?"" (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans under my protection.' And we requested Bilal not to inform the Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, ""Who are those two?"" Bilal replied that she was Zainab. The Prophet said, ""Which Zainab?"" Bilal said, ""The wife of `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud)."" The Prophet said, ""Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving Zakat."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zainab:                     (the daughter of Um Salama) My mother said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Shall I receive a reward if I spend for the sustenance of Abu Salama's offspring, and in fact they are also my sons?"" The Prophet replied, ""Spend on them and you will get a reward for what you spend on them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib had refused to give Zakat."" The Prophet said, ""What made Ibn Jamil refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and was made wealthy by Allah and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for Allah's Cause (for Jihad). As for `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib, he is the uncle of Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it double."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave them again till all that was with him finished. And then he said ""If I had anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember) Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than patience."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is better for anyone of you to take a rope and cut the wood (from the forest) and carry it over his back and sell it (as a means of earning his living) rather than to ask a person for something and that person may give him or not."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zubair bin Al-`Awwam:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""It is better for anyone of you to take a rope (and cut) and bring a bundle of wood (from the forest) over his back and sell it and Allah will save his face (from the Hell-Fire) because of that, rather than to ask the people who may give him or not."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair and Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab:                     Hakim bin Hizam said, ""(Once) I asked Allah's Apostle (for something) and he gave it to me. Again I asked and he gave (it to me). Again I asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, ""O Hakim! This property is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand."" Hakim added, ""I said to Allah's Apostle , 'By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.' "" Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to accept anything. Then `Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that `Umar said, ""O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share from this booty and he refused to take it."" So Hakim never took anything from anybody after the Prophet till he died."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle used to give me something but I would say to him, ""would you give it to a poorer and more needy one than l?"" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to me, ""Take it. If you are given something from this property, without asking for it or having greed for it take it; and if not given, do not run for it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""A man keeps on asking others for something till he comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his face."" The Prophet added, ""On the Day of Resurrection, the Sun will come near (to, the people) to such an extent that the sweat will reach up to the middle of the ears, so, when all the people are in that state, they will ask Adam for help, and then Moses, and then Muhammad (p.b.u.h) ."" The sub-narrator added ""Muhammad will intercede with Allah to judge amongst the people. He will proceed on till he will hold the ring of the door (of Paradise) and then Allah will exalt him to Maqam Mahmud (the privilege of intercession, etc.). And all the people of the gathering will send their praises to Allah."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The poor person is not the one who asks a morsel or two (of meals) from the others, but the poor is the one who has nothing and is ashamed to beg from others."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ash-Shu`bi:                     The clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba narrated, ""Muawiya wrote to Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba: Write to me something which you have heard from the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ."" So Al-Mughira wrote: I heard the Prophet saying, ""Allah has hated for you three things: -1. Vain talks, (useless talk) that you talk too much or about others. -2. Wasting of wealth (by extravagance) -3. And asking too many questions (in disputed religious matters) or asking others for something (except in great need). (See Hadith No. 591, Vol. Ill)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`d (bin Abi Waqqas):                     Allah's Apostle distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to Allah's Apostle and asked him secretly, ""Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer."" The Prophet said, ""Or merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Allah)."" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer. "" The Prophet said, ""Or merely a Muslim."" I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Allah! I consider him a believer."" The Prophet said, ""Or merely a Muslim."" Then Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, ""I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by reneging from Islam)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""The poor person is not the one who goes round the people and ask them for a mouthful or two (of meals) or a date or two but the poor is that who has not enough (money) to satisfy his needs and whose condition is not known to others, that others may give him something in charity, and who does not beg of people."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""No doubt, it is better for a person to take a rope and proceed in the morning to the mountains and cut the wood and then sell it, and eat from this income and give alms from it than to ask others for something."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi:                     We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and Allah's Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, ""Check what your garden will yield."" When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, ""There will be a strong wind tonight and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it."" So we fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al- Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, ""Ten Awsuq,"" and that was what Allah's Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, ""I want to reach Medina quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up."" The sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina he said, ""This is Taba."" And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said, ""This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the Ansar?"" They replied in the affirmative. He said, ""The family of Bani-n-Najjar, and then the family of Bani Sa`ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah from his father:                     The Prophet said, ""On a land irrigated by rain water or by natural water channels or if the land is wet due to a near by water channel Ushr (i.e. one-tenth) is compulsory (as Zakat); and on the land irrigated by the well, half of an Ushr (i.e. one-twentieth) is compulsory (as Zakat on the yield of the land)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""There is no Zakat on less than five Awsuq (of dates), or on less than five camels, or on less than five Awaq of silver."" (22 Yemeni Riyals Faransa)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Dates used to be brought to Allah's Apostle immediately after being plucked. Different persons would bring their dates till a big heap collected (in front of the Prophet). Once Al-Hasan and Al-Husain were playing with these dates. One of them took a date and put it in his mouth. Allah's Apostle looked at him and took it out from his mouth and said, ""Don't you know that Muhammad's offspring do not eat what is given in charity?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet had forbidden the sale of dates till they were good (ripe), and when it was asked what it meant, the Prophet said, ""Till there is no danger of blight."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet had forbidden the sale of fruits till they were ripe (free from blight).
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle forbade the selling of fruits until they were ripe. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) added, ""It means that they become red ."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     `Umar bin Al-Khattab gave a horse in charity in Allah's Cause and later he saw it being sold in the market and intended to purchase it. Then he went to the Prophet and asked his permission. The Prophet said, ""Do not take back what you have given in charity."" For this reason, Ibn `Umar never purchased the things which he had given in charity, and in case he had purchased something (unknowingly) he would give it in charity again."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     Once I gave a horse in Allah's Cause (in charity) but that person did not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell it at a low price. So, I asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h) about it. He said, ""Neither buy, nor take back your alms which you have given, even if the seller were willing to sell it for one Dirham, for he who takes back his alms is like the one who swallows his own vomit."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Al-Hasan bin `Ali took a date from the dates given in charity and put it in his mouth. The Prophet said, ""Expel it from your mouth. Don't you know that we do not eat a thing which is given in charity?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet saw a dead sheep which had been given in charity to a freed slave-girl of Maimuna, the wife of the Prophet .

Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     `Aisha intended to buy Barira (a slave-girl) in order to manumit her and her masters intended to put the condition that her Al-wala would be for them. `Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet who said to her, ""Buy her, as the ""Wala"" is for the manumitted."" Once some meat was presented to the Prophet and `Aisha said to him, ""This (meat) was given in charity to Barira."" He said, ""It is an object of charity for Barira but a gift for us."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um 'Atiyya Al-Ansariya:                     The Prophet went to `Aisha and asked her whether she had something (to eat). She replied that she had nothing except the mutton (piece) which Nusaiba (Um 'Atiyya) had sent to us (Buraira) in charity."" The Prophet said, ""It has reached its place and now it is not a thing of charity but a gift for us."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Some meat was presented to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and it had been given to Barira (the freed slave-girl of Aisha) in charity. He said, ""This meat is a thing of charity for Barira but it is a gift for us."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Ma`bad:                     (the slave of Ibn `Abbas) Allah's Apostle said to Mu`adh when he sent him to Yemen, ""You will go to the people of the Scripture. So, when you reach there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best of their possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because there is no screen between his invocation and Allah."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abu Aufa :                          Whenever a person came to the Prophet with his alms, the Prophet would     say, ""O Allah! Send your Blessings upon so and so."" My father went to      the Prophet with his alms and the Prophet said, ""O Allah! Send your      blessings upon the offspring of Abu Aufa."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira     The Prophet said, ""A man from Bani Israel asked someone from Bani      Israel to give him a loan of one thousand Dinars and the later gave it     to him. The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of      the debt became due) but he did not find a boat, so he took a piece of     wood and bored it and put 1000 diners in it and threw it into the sea.     The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his family to be      used as fire-wood."" (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3). And the Prophet      narrated the narration (and said), ""When he sawed the wood, he found      his money."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There is no compensation for one killed or wounded by an animal or by falling in a well, or because of working in mines; but Khumus is compulsory on Rikaz."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa`idi:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutbiya, from the tribe of Al-Asd to collect Zakat from Bani Sulaim. When he returned, (after collecting the Zakat) the Prophet checked the account with him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Some people from `Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not suit them, so Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) allowed them to go to the herd of camels (given as Zakat) and they drank their milk and urine (as medicine) but they killed the shepherd and drove away all the camels. So Allah's Apostle sent (men) in their pursuit to catch them, and they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron and they were left in the Harra (a stony place at Medina) biting the stones. (See Hadith No. 234, Vol. 1)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     I took `Abdullah bin Abu Talha to Allah's Apostle to perform Tahnik for him. (Tahnik was a custom among the Muslims that whenever a child was born they used to take it to the Prophet who would chew a piece of date and put a part of its juice in the child's mouth). I saw the Prophet and he had an instrument for branding in his hands and was branding the camels of Zakat.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle enjoined the payment of one Sa' of dates or one Sa' of barley as Zakat-ul-Fitr on every Muslim slave or free, male or female, young or old, and he ordered that it be paid before the people went out to offer the `Id prayer. (One Sa' = 3 Kilograms approx.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle made it incumbent on all the slave or free Muslims, male or female, to pay one Sa' of dates or barley as Zakat-ul-Fitr."

Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet ordered (Muslims) to give one Sa' of dates or one Sa' of barley as Zakat-ul-Fitr. The people rewarded two Mudds of wheat as equal to that.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     In the lifetime of the Prophet we used to give one Sa' of food or one Sa' of dates or one Sa' of barley or one Sa' of Raisins (dried grapes) as Sadaqat-ul-Fitr. And when Muawiya became the Caliph and the wheat was (available in abundance) he said, ""I think (observe) that one Mudd (of wheat) equals two Mudds (of any of the above mentioned things)."

Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar said, ""The Prophet made incumbent on every male or female, free man or slave, the payment of one Sa' of dates or barley as Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (or said Sadaqa-Ramadan)."" The people then substituted half Sa' of wheat for that. Ibn `Umar used to give dates (as Sadaqat-ul-Fitr). Once there was scarcity of dates in Medina and Ibn `Umar gave barley. 'And Ibn `Umar used to give Sadaqat-ul- Fitr for every young and old person. He even used to give on behalf of my children. Ibn `Umar used to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr to those who had been officially appointed for its collection. People used to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (even) a day or two before the `Id."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle has made Sadaqat-ul-Fitr obligatory, (and it was), either one Sa' of barley or one Sa' of dates (and its payment was obligatory) on young and old people, and on free men as well as on slaves."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah's Apostle and a woman from the tribe of Khath'am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl's face to the other side. The woman said, ""O Allah's Apostle! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?"" The Prophet replied, ""Yes, you may."" That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet )."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     I saw that Allah's Apostle used to ride on his Mount at Dhul Hulaifa and used to start saying, ""Labbaik"" when the Mount stood upright."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     that Allah's Apostle started saying, ""Labbaik"" from Dhul-Hulaifa when his Mount stood upright carrying him ."
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Aishah:                      The Prophet () sent my brother, 'Abdur Rahman with me to Tan'im for the 'Umra, and he made me ride on the packsaddle (of a camel). 'Umar said, ""Be ready to travel for Hajj as it (Hajj) is one of the two kind of Jihad""."
Sarah,30," Narrated Thumama bin `Abdullah bin Anas:                     Anas performed the Hajj on a packsaddle and he was not a miser. Anas said, ""Allah's Apostle performed Hajj on a packsaddle and the same Mount was carrying his baggage too."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:                     `Aisha said, ""O Allah's Apostle! You performed `Umra but I did not."" He said, ""O `Abdur-Rahman! Go along with your sister and let her perform `Umra from Tan`im."" `Abdur-Rahman made her ride over the packsaddle of a she-camel and she performed `Umra."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet was asked, ""Which is the best deed?"" He said, ""To believe in Allah and His Apostle."" He was then asked, ""Which is the next (in goodness)?"" He said, ""To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause."" He was then asked, ""Which is the next?"" He said, ""To perform Hajj-Mabrur. """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the mother of the faithful believers) I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed."" The Prophet said, ""The best Jihad (for women) is Hajj Mabrur. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""Whoever performs Hajj for Allah's pleasure and does not have sexual relations with his wife, and does not do evil or sins then he will return (after Hajj free from all sins) as if he were born anew."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:                     I went to visit `Abdullah bin `Umar at his house which contained many tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for Umra. He said, ""Allah's Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The people of Yemen used to come for Hajj and used not to bring enough provisions with them and used to say that they depend on Allah. On their arrival in Medina they used to beg the people, and so Allah revealed, ""And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the fear of Allah."" (2.197)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) made Dhul-Huiaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing Hajj and `Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""Allah's Apostle said, 'The people of Medina should assume lhram from Dhul-Hulaifa; the people of Sham from Al-Juhfa; and the people of Najd from Qarn."" And `Abdullah added, ""I was informed that Allah's Apostle had said, 'The people of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and `Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca."
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim from his father who said:                     ""The Prophet had fixed the Mawaqit as follows: (No. 603)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah from his father:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""The Miqat for the people of Medina is Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn `Umar, ""They claim, but I did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, ""The Miqat for the people of Yemen is Yalamlam."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, and Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqit are for those living at those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is living inside these places can assume lhram from his own dwelling place, and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca."

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     When these two towns (Basra and Kufa) were captured, the people went to `Umar and said, ""O the Chief of the faithful believers! The Prophet fixed Qarn as the Miqat for the people of Najd, it is beyond our way and it is difficult for us to pass through it."" He said, ""Take as your Miqat a place situated opposite to Qarn on your usual way. So, he fixed Dhatu-Irq (as their Miqat)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar' said, ""Allah's Apostle made his camel sit (i.e. he dismounted) at Al-Batha' in Dhul-Hulaifa and offered the prayer."" `Abdullah bin `Umar used to do the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle used to go (for Hajj) via Ash-Shajara way and return via Muarras way; and no doubt, whenever Allah's Apostle went to Mecca, he used to offer the prayer in the Mosque of Ash-Shajara; and on his return, he used to offer the prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa in the middle of the valley, and pass the night there till morning."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     In the valley of Al-`Aqiq I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""To night a messenger came to me from my Lord and asked me to pray in this blessed valley and to assume Ihram for Hajj and `Umra together. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Musa bin `Uqba:                     Salim bin `Abdullah's father said, ""The Prophet said that while resting in the bottom of the valley at Muarras in Dhul-Hulaifa, he had been addressed in a dream: 'You are verily in a blessed valley.' "" Salim made us to dismount from our camels at the place where `Abdullah used to dismount, aiming at the place where Allah's Apostle had rested and it was below the Mosque situated in the middle of the valley in between them (the residence) and the road."
Sarah,30," Narrated Safwan bin Ya'la:                      Ya'la said to 'Umar, ""Show me the Prophet () when he is being inspired Divinely."" While the Prophet () was at Ji'rana (in the company of some of his Companions) a person came and asked, ""O Allah's Messenger! What is your verdict regarding that person who assumes Ihram for 'Umra and is scented with perfume ?"" The Prophet () kept quiet for a while and he was Divinely inspired (then). 'Umar beckoned Ya'la. So he came, and the Allah's Messenger () was shaded with sheet. Ya'la put his head in and saw that the face of Allah's Messenger was red and he was snoring. When the state of the Prophet () was over, he () asked, ""Where is the person who asked about 'Umra?"" Then that person was brought and the Prophet () said, ""Wash the perfume off your body thrice and take off the cloak and do the same in 'Umra as you do in Hajj."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     Ibn `Umar used to oil his hair. I told that to Ibrahim who said, ""What do you think about this statement: Narrated Aswad from `Aisha: As if I were now observing the glitter of the scent in the parting of the hair of the Prophet while he was Muhrim?"""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) I used to scent Allah's Apostle when he wanted to assume Ihram and also on finishing Ihram before the Tawaf round the Ka`ba (Tawaf-al-ifada).
Sarah,30, Narrated Salim from his father:                     I heard that Allah's Apostle assumed Ihram with his hair matted together.
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah:                     I heard my father saying, ""Never did Allah's Apostle assume Ihram except at the Mosque, that is, at the Mosque of Dhul-Hulaifa."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     A man asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! What kind of clothes should a Muhrim wear?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a headcloak or leather socks except if he can find no slippers, he then may wear leather socks after cutting off what might cover the ankles.

Sarah,30," Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah:                     Ibn `Abbas' said, ""Usama rode behind Allah's Apostle from `Arafat to Al-Muzdalifa; and then Al-Fadl rode behind Allah's Apostle from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina."" Ibn `Abbas added, ""Both of them said, 'The Prophet kept on reciting Talbiya till he did the Rami of Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida', where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa'da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka`ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka`ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from `Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka`ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet offered four rak`at in Medina and then two rak`at at Dhul Hulaifa and then passed the night at Dhul-Hulaifa till it was morning and when he mounted his Mount and it stood up, he started to recite Talbiya."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Qilaba:                     Anas bin Malik said, ""The Prophet offered four rak`at of the Zuhr prayer in Medina and two rak`at of `Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa."" I think that the Prophet passed the night there till morning."
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet offered four rak`at of the Zuhr prayer in Medina and two rak`at of the `Asr prayer in Dhul-Hulaifa and I heard them (the companions of the Prophet) reciting Talbiya together loudly to the extent of shouting.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Talbiya of Allah's Apostle was : 'Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, Labbaika la sharika Laka labbaik, Inna-l-hamda wan-ni'mata Laka walmulk, La sharika Laka' (I respond to Your call O Allah, I respond to Your call, and I am obedient to Your orders, You have no partner, I respond to Your call All the praises and blessings are for You, All the sovereignty is for You, And You have no partners with you."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I know how the Prophet used to say (Talbiya) and it was: 'Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik, Labbaika la sharika Laka labbaik, Inna-l-hamda wan-ni'mata Laka walmu Lk, La sharika Laka'."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle offered four rak`at of Zuhr prayer at Medina and we were in his company, and two rak`at of the `Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa and then passed the night there till it was dawn; then he rode, and when he reached Al-Baida', he praised and glorified Allah and said Takbir (i.e. Al hamdu-li l-lah and Subhanallah(1) and Allahu-Akbar). Then he and the people along with him recited Talbiya with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra. When we reached (Mecca) he ordered us to finish the lhram (after performing the Umra) (only those who had no Hadi (animal for sacrifice) with them were asked to do so) till the day of Tarwiya that is 8th Dhul-Hijja when they assumed Ihram for Hajj. The Prophet sacrificed many camels (slaughtering them) with his own hands while standing. While Allah's Apostle was in Medina he sacrificed two horned rams black and white in color in the Name of Allah."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited Talbiya when he had mounted his Mount and was ready to set out.
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi', 'Whenever Ibn 'Umar finished his morning Salat at Dhul-Hulaifa he would get his Rahila (mount) prepared. Then, he would ride on it, and after it had stood up straight (ready to set out), he would face Al-Qiblah (the Ka,bah at Makkah) while sitting (on his mount) and recite Talbiya. When he had reached the boundaries of the Haram (or Makkah), he would stop recitation of Talbiya till he reached Dhi-Tuwa (near Makkah) where he would pass the night till it was dawn. After offering the morning Salat, he would take a bath. He claimed that Allah's Messenger () had done the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Whenever Ibn `Umar intended to go to Mecca he used to oil himself with a sort of oil that had no pleasant smell, then he would go to the Mosque of Al-Hulaita and offer the prayer, and then ride. When he mounted well on his Mount and the Mount stood up straight, he would proclaim the intention of assuming Ihram, and he used to say that he had seen the Prophet doing the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mujahid:                     I was in the company of Ibn `Abbas and the people talked about Ad-Dajjal and said, ""Ad-Dajjal will come with the word Kafir (non-believer) written in between his eyes."" On that Ibn `Abbas said, ""I have not heard this from the Prophet but I heard him saying, 'As if I saw Moses just now entering the valley reciting Talbyia. ' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, ""Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with `Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both."" I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka`ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, ""Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra."" So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan`im. So I performed the `Umra. The Prophet said to me, ""This `Umra is instead of your missed one."" Those who had assumed Ihram for `Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and `Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ata:                     Jabir said, ""The Prophet ordered `Ali to keep on assuming his Ihram."" The narrator then informed about the narration of Suraqa."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     `Ali came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) from Yemen (to Mecca). The Prophet asked `Ali, ""With what intention have you assumed Ihram?"" `Ali replied, ""I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet."" The Prophet said, ""If I had not the Hadi with me I would have finished the Ihram."" Muhammad bin Bakr narrated extra from Ibn Juraij, ""The Prophet said to `Ali, ""With what intention have you assumed the Ihram, O `Ali?"" He replied, ""With the same (intention) as that of the Prophet."" The Prophet said, ""Have a Hadi and keep your Ihram as it is."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found him at Al-Batha. He asked me, ""With what intention have you assumed Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?"") I replied, ""I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet."" He asked, ""Have you a Hadi with you?"" I replied in the negative. He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when `Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, ""If we follow Allah's Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: ""Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah."" (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hadi."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:                     ' Aisha said, ""We set out with Allah's Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj.

Allah's Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, ""Allah's Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, ""What makes you weep, O Hantah?"" I replied, ""I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra."" He asked, ""What is wrong with you?' I replied, ' I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).' He said, ' It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that."" Aisha further added, ""Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba."" Aisha added, ""I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him."" He called ' `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, ' Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for ' `Umra, and when you had finished ' `Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.'

Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     ' Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet's wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram."" `Aisha added, ""I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba."" So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and `Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.' He said, 'Didn't you perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba the night we reached Mecca?' I replied in the negative. He said, 'Go with your brother to Tan`im and assume the Ihram for `Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.' On that Safiya said, 'I feel that I will detain you all.' The Prophet said, 'O 'Aqra Halqa! Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba on the day of sacrifice?

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We set out with Allah's Apostles (to Mecca) in the year of the Prophet's Last Hajj. Some of us had assumed Ihram for `Umra only, some for both Hajj and `Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah's Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and `Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam:                     I saw `Uthman and `Ali. `Uthman used to forbid people to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu` and Hajj-al- Qiran (Hajj and `Umra together), and when `Ali saw (this act of `Uthman), he assumed Ihram for Hajj and `Umra together saying, ""Lubbaik for `Umra and Hajj,"" and said, ""I will not leave the tradition of the Prophet on the saying of somebody."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The people (of the Pre-Islamic Period) used to think that to perform `Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, ""When the wounds of the camel's back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) `Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it."" In the morning of the 4th of Dhul- Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for `Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?"" The Prophet replied, ""Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything)."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Musa:                     came to the Prophet (from Yemen and was assuming Ihram for Hajj) and he ordered me to finish the Ihram (after performing the `Umra).
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Hafsa the wife of the Prophet said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why have the people finished their Ihram after performing `Umra but you have not finished your Ihram after performing `Umra?"" He replied, ""I have matted my hair and garlanded my Hadi. So I will not finish my Ihram till I have slaughtered (my Hadi). """
Sarah,30," Narrated Shu`ba:                     Abu Jamra Nasr bin `Imran Ad-Duba'i said, ""I intended to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu` and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn `Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at- Tammatu'. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, 'Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet's tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted `Umra.' So I told that dream to Ibn `Abbas. He said, 'This is the tradition of Abul-Qasim.' Then he said to me, 'Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.' "" I (Shu`ba) asked, ""Why (did he invite you)?"" He (Abu Jamra) said, ""Because of the dream which I had seen."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Shihab:                     I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu` assuming Ihram for `Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, ""Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to `Ata' asking him his view about it. He said, ""Jabir bin `Abdullah narrated to me, 'I performed Hajj with Allah's Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka`ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for `Umra only. They asked, 'How can we make it `Umra (Tamattu`) as we have intended to perform Hajj?' The Prophet said, 'Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).' So, they did (what he ordered them to do)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab:                     `Ali and `Uthman differed regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu` while they were at 'Usfan (a familiar place near Mecca). `Ali said, ""I see you want to forbid people to do a thing that the Prophet did?"" When `Ali saw that, he assumed Ihram for both Hajj and `Umra."
Sarah,30, Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     We came with Allah's Apostle (to Mecca) and we were saying: 'Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik' for Hajj. Allah's Apostle ordered us to perform `Umra with that Ihram (instead of Hajj).
Sarah,30, Narrated `Imran:                     We performed Hajj-at-Tamattu` in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle and then the Qur'an was revealed (regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu`) and somebody said what he wished (regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu`) according his own opinion.
Sarah,30," Ibn 'Abbas said that he has been asked regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu' on which he said, ""The Muhajirin and the Ansar and the wives of the Prophet () and we did the same. When we reached Makkah, Allah's Messenger () said, ""Give up your intention of doing the Hajj (at this moment) and perform 'Umra, except the one who had garlanded the Hady."" So, we performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and [Sa'y] between As-safa and Al-MArwa, slept with our wives and wore ordinary (stitched) clothes. The Prophet () added, ""Whoever has garlanded his Hady is not allowed to finish the Ihram till the Hady has reached its destination (has been sacrificed)"". Then on the night of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijjah, in the afternoon) he ordered us to assume Ihram for Hajj and when we have performed all the ceremonies of Hajj, we came and performed Tawaf round the Ka'bah and (Sa'y) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa, and then our Hajj was complete, and we had to sacrifice a Hady according to the statement of Allah:                      ""... He must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observer Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)…."" (V. 2:196).And the sacrifice of the sheep is sufficient. So, the Prophet (saw) and his Companions honied the two religious deeds, (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) in one year, for Allah revealed (the permissibility) of such practice in His book and in the Sunna (legal ways) of His Prophet () and rendered it permissible for all the people except those living in Makkah. Allah says: ""This is for him whose family is not present at the Al-Masjid-Al-Haram, (i.e. non resident of Makkah)."" The months of Hajj which Allah mentioned in His book are: Shawwal, Dhul-Qa'da and Dhul-Hijjah. Whoever performed Hajj-at-Tamattu' in those months, then slaughtering or fasting is compulsory for him.The words: 1. Ar-Rafatha means sexual intercourse. 2. Al-Fasuq means all kinds of sin, and 3. Al-Jidal means to dispute."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     On reaching the sanctuary of Mecca, Ibn `Umar used to stop, reciting Talbiya and then he would pass the night at Dhi-Tuwa and then offer the Fajr prayer and take a bath. He used to say that the Prophet used to do the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     ' Ibn `Umar said, ""The Prophet passed the night at Dhi-Tuwa till it was dawn and then he entered Mecca."" Ibn `Umar used to do the same."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle used to enter Mecca from the high Thaniya and used to leave Mecca from the low Thaniya.
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle entered Mecca from Kada' from the highest Thaniya which is at Al-Batha' and used to leave Mecca from the low Thaniya.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     When the Prophet came to Mecca he entered from its higher side and left from its lower side.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha':                     In the year of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet entered Mecca from Kada' and left Mecca from Kuda, from the higher part of Mecca."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     In the year of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet entered Mecca from Kada' at the higher place of Mecca. (Hisham, a sub-narrator said, "" `Urwa used to enter (Mecca) from both Kada' and Kuda and he often entered through Kada' which was nearer to his dwelling place.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Hisham:                     `Urwa said, ""The Prophet entered Mecca in the year of the conquest of Mecca from the side of Kada' which is at the higher part of Mecca."" `Urwa often entered from Kada' which was nearer of the two to his dwelling place."
Sarah,30," Narrated Hisham from his father:                     In the year of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet entered Mecca from the side of Kada. `Urwa used to enter through both places and he often entered through Kada' which was nearer of the two to his dwelling place."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     When the Ka`ba was built, the Prophet and `Abbas went to bring stones (for its construction). Al `Abbas said to the Prophet, ""Take off your waist sheet and put it on your neck."" (When the Prophet took it off) he fell on the ground with his eyes open towards the sky and said, ""Give me my waist sheet."" And he covered himself with it."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) that Allah's Apostle said to her, ""Do you know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka`ba, they decreased it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?"" I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Why don't you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?"" He replied, ""Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so."" The sub-narrator, `Abdullah (bin `Umar ) stated: `Aisha 'must have heard this from Allah's Apostle for in my opinion Allah's Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka`ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka`ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka`ba) was part of the Ka`ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, ""What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka`ba?"" He said, ""Don't you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka`ba)?"" I asked, ""What about its gate? Why is it so high?"" He replied, ""Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka`ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle said to me, ""Were your people not close to the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance, I would have demolished the Ka`ba and would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by Abraham (for Quraish had curtailed its building), and I would have built a back door (too)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Yazid bin Ruman from `Urwa:                     `Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, ""O Aisha! Were your nation not close to the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka`ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham."" That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka`ba. Jazz said, ""I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka`ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka`ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the northwest of the Ka`ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels."" So Jarir asked Yazid, ""Where was the place of those stones?"" Jazz said, ""I will just now show it to you."" So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, ""Here it is."" Jarir said, ""It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     On the Day of the Conquest of Mecca, Allah's Apostle said, ""Allah has made this town a sanctuary. Its thorny bushes should not be cut, its game should not be chased, and its fallen things should not be picked up except by one who would announce it publicly."""
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Usama bin Zaid:                     I asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Where will you stay in Mecca? Will you stay in your house in Mecca?"" He replied, ""Has `Aqil left any property or house?"" `Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib. Jafar and `Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, ""A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel."" Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, ""They (`Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah's Statement: ""Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah's Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another."" (8.72)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     When Allah's Apostle intended to enter Mecca he said, ""Our destination tomorrow, if Allah wished, will be Khaif Bani Kinana where (the pagans) had taken the oath of Kufr."" (Against the Prophet i.e. to be loyal to heathenism by boycotting Bani Hashim, the Prophets folk) (See Hadith No. 221 Vol. 5)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     On the Day of Nahr at Mina, the Prophet said, ""Tomorrow we shall stay at Khaif Bani Kinana where the pagans had taken the oath of Kufr (heathenism)."" He meant (by that place) Al-Muhassab where the Quraish tribe and Bani Kinana concluded a contract against Bani Hashim and Bani `Abdul-Muttalib or Bani Al-Muttalib that they would not intermarry with them or deal with them in business until they handed over the Prophet to them."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet;; said, ""Dhus-Suwaiqa-tain (literally: One with two lean legs) from Ethiopia will demolish the Ka`ba."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The people used to fast on 'Ashura (the tenth day of the month of Muharram) before the fasting of Ramadan was made obligatory. And on that day the Ka`ba used to be covered with a cover. When Allah made the fasting of the month of Ramadan compulsory, Allah's Apostle said, ""Whoever wishes to fast (on the day of 'Ashura') may do so; and whoever wishes to leave it can do so."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said ""The people will continue performing the Hajj and `Umra to the Ka`ba even after the appearance of Gog and Magog."" Narrated Shu`ba extra: The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till the Hajj (to the Ka`ba) is abandoned."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wail:                     (One day) I sat along with Shaiba on the chair inside the Ka`ba. He (Shaiba) said, ""No doubt, `Umar sat at this place and said, 'I intended not to leave any yellow (i.e. gold) or white (i.e. silver) (inside the Ka`ba) undistributed.' I said (to `Umar), 'But your two companions (i.e. The Prophet and Abu Bakr) did not do so.' `Umar said, They are the two persons whom I always follow.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, ""As if I were looking at him, a black person with thin legs plucking the stones of the Ka`ba one after another. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Dhus-Suwaiqatain (the thin legged man) from Ethiopia will demolish the Ka`ba."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abis bin Rabi`a:                     `Umar came near the Black Stone and kissed it and said ""No doubt, I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Apostle kissing you I would not have kissed you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim that his father said:                     ""Allah's Apostle, Usama bin Zaid, Bilal, and `Uthman bin abu Talha entered the Ka`ba and then closed its door. When they opened the door I was the first person to enter (the Ka`ba). I met Bilal and asked him, ""Did Allah's Apostle offer a prayer inside (the Ka`ba)?"" Bilal replied in the affirmative and said, ""(The Prophet offered the prayer) in between the two right pillars."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Whenever Ibn `Umar entered the Ka`ba he used to walk straight keeping the door at his back on entering, and used to proceed on till about three cubits from the wall in front of him, and then he would offer the prayer there aiming at the place where Allah's Apostle prayed, as Bilal had told him. There is no harm for any person to offer the prayer at any place inside the Ka`ba."
Sarah,30," Narrated Isma'li bin Abu Khalid:                     `Abdullah bin Abu `Aufa said, ""Allah's Apostle performed the `Umra. He performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and offered two rak`at behind the Maqam (Abraham's place) and was accompanied by those who were screening him from the people."" Somebody asked `Abdullah, ""Did Allah's Apostle enter the Ka`ba?"" `Abdullah replied in the negative."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     When Allah's Apostle came to Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka`ba with idols in it. He ordered (idols to be taken out). So they were taken out. The people took out the pictures of Abraham and Ishmael holding Azlams in their hands. Allah's Apostle said, ""May Allah curse these people. By Allah, both Abraham and Ishmael never did the game of chance with Azlams."" Then he entered the Ka`ba and said Takbir at its corners but did not offer the prayer in it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     When Allah's Apostle and his companions came to Mecca, the pagans circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and they had been weakened by the Fever of Yathrib (Medina). So the Prophet ordered his companions to do Ramal in the first three rounds of Tawaf of the Ka`ba and to walk between the two corners (The Black Stone and Yemenite corner). The Prophet did not order them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf out of pity for them."
Sarah,30, Narrated Salim that his father said:                     I saw Allah's Apostle arriving at Mecca; he kissed the Black Stone Corner first while doing Tawaf and did ramal in the first three rounds of the seven rounds (of Tawaf).
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet did Ramal in (first) three rounds (of Tawaf), and walked in the remaining four, in Hajj and Umra."
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father who said:                     ""`Umar bin Al-Khattab addressed the Corner (Black Stone) saying, 'By Allah! I know that you are a stone and can neither benefit nor harm. Had I not seen the Prophet touching (and kissing) you, I would never have touched (and kissed) you.' Then he kissed it and said, 'There is no reason for us to do Ramal (in Tawaf) except that we wanted to show off before the pagans, and now Allah has destroyed them.' `Umar added, '(Nevertheless), the Prophet did that and we do not want to leave it (i.e. Ramal).'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar. said, ""I have never missed the touching of these two stones of Ka`ba (the Black Stone and the Yemenite Corner) both in the presence and the absence of crowds, since I saw the Prophet touching them."" I asked Nafi`: ""Did Ibn `Umar use to walk between the two Corners?"" Nafi` replied, ""He used to walk in order that it might be easy for him to touch it (the Corner Stone)."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas.:                     In his Last Hajj the Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba riding a camel and pointed a bent-headed stick towards the Corner (Black Stone).
Sarah,30," Abu Ash-Sha'tha said, ""Who keeps away from some portion of the Ka'bah?"" Mu'awiya used to touch the four corners of the Ka'bah, Ibn 'Abbas said to him, ""These two corners (the one facing the Hijr) are not to be touched."" Mu'awiya said, ""Nothing is untouchable in the Ka'bah."" And Ibn Az-Zubair used to touch all the corners of the Ka'bah."

Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zubair bin 'Arabi:                     A man asked Ibn `Umar about the touching of the Black Stone. Ibn `Umar said, ""I saw Allah's Apostle touching and kissing it."" The questioner said, ""But if there were a throng (much rush) round the Ka`ba and the people overpowered me, (what would I do?)"" He replied angrily, ""Stay in Yemen (as that man was from Yemen). I saw Allah's Apostle touching and kissing it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba while riding a camel, and whenever he came in front of the Corner, he pointed towards it (with something)."

Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     `Aisha said, ""The first thing the Prophet did on reaching Mecca, was the ablution and then he performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and that was not `Umra (alone), (but Hajj-al-Qiran). `Urwa added: Later Abu Bakr and `Umar did the same in their Hajj."" And I performed the Hajj with my father Az- Zubair, and the first thing he did was Tawaf of the Ka`ba. Later I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and the Ansar doing the same. My mother (Asma') told me that she, her sister (`Aisha), Az-Zubair and such and such persons assumed Ihram for `Umra, and after they passed their hands over the Black Stone Corner (of the Ka`ba) they finished the Ihram. (i.e. After doing Tawaf of the Ka`ba and Sa`i between Safa-Marwa."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     When Allah's Apostle performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba for Hajj or `Umra, he used to do Ramal during the first three rounds, and in the last four rounds he used to walk; then after the Tawaf he used to offer two rak`at and then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."

Sarah,30," Ibn Juraij said, "" 'Ata informed us that when Ibn Hisham forbade women to perform Tawaf with men he said to him, 'How do you forbid them while the wives of the Prophet () used to perform Tawaf with the men ?' I said, 'Was this before decreeing of the use of the veil or after it ? 'Ata took an oath and said, 'I saw it after the order of veil.' I said, 'How did they mix with the men?' 'Ata said, 'The women never mixed with the men, and 'Aishah used to perform Tawaf separately and never mixed with men. Once it happened that 'Aishah was performing the Tawaf and woman said to her, 'O Mother of believers! Let us touch the Black stone.'  'Aishah said to her, 'Go yourself,' and she herself refused to do so. The wives of the Prophet () used to come out in night, in disguise and used to perform Tawaf with men. But whenever they intended to enter the Ka'bah, they would stay outside till the men had gone out. I and 'Ubaid bin 'Umair used to visit  'Aishah while she was residing at Jauf Thabir."" I asked, ""What was her veil?"" 'Ata said, ""She was wearing and old turkish veil, and that was the only thing (weal) which was screen between us and her. I saw a pink cover on her."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     (the wife of the Prophet) I informed Allah's Apostle that I was ill. So he said, ""Perform the Tawaf while riding behind the people."" I did so, and at that time the Prophet was praying beside the Ka`ba and reciting Surat-at-Tur."

So she did the same and did not offer the two rak`at of Tawaf until she came out of the Mosque."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet reached Mecca, circumambulated the Ka`ba seven times and then offered a two rak`at prayer behind Maqam Ibrahim. Then he went towards the Safa. Allah has said, ""Verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     I informed Allah's Apostle that I was sick. He said, ""Perform Tawaf (of the Ka`ba) while riding behind the people."" So, I performed the Tawaf while Allah's Apostle was offering the prayer beside the Ka`ba and was reciting Surat-at-Tur."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Al `Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib asked the permission of Allah's Apostle to let him stay in Mecca during the nights of Mina in order to provide the pilgrims with water to drink, so the Prophet permitted him."

Allah's Apostle again said, 'Give me water to drink.

The Prophet then said to them, ""Carry on! You are doing a good deed."" Then he said, ""Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zamzam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water)."" On saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik that Abu Dhar said:                      Allah's Messenger  () said, ""The roof of my house was made open while I was at Makkah (on the night of Mi'raj) and Jibril descended. He opened up my chest and washed it with the water of Zamzam. The he brought the golden tray full of Wisdom and Belief and poured it in my chest and then closed it. The he took hold of my hand and ascended to the nearest heaven. Jibril told the gatekeeper of the nearest heaven to open the gate. The gatekeeper asked, ""Who is it?"" Jibril replied, ""I am Jibril."" (See Hadith No. 349 Vol.1)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I gave Zamzam water to Allah's Apostle and he drank it while standing. 'Asia (a sub-narrator) said that `Ikrima took the oath that on that day the Prophet had not been standing but riding a camel.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We set out with Allah's Apostle in the year of his Last Hajj and we mended (the Ihram) for `Umra. Then the Prophet said, ""Whoever has a Hadi with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and `Umra, and should not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and `Umra)."" When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with `Abdur-Rahman to Tan`im and I performed the `Umra. The Prophet said, ""This is in lieu of your missed `Umra."" Those who had assumed Ihram for `Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and `Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran ) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Abdullah bin `Umar and his riding animal entered the house of Ibn `Umar. He (the son of Ibn `Umar) said, ""I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka`ba. I suggest that you should stay here."" Ibn `Umar said, ""Once Allah's Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka`ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka`ba, I would do the same as Allah's Apostle had done . . . ""Verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example."" Then he added, ""I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with `Umra."" After arriving at Mecca, Ibn `Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn `Umar, ""There is a danger of an impending war between them."" Ibn `Umar said, ""Verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah's Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform `Umra."" Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida', he said, ""The ceremonies of both Hajj and `Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with `Umra."" He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and `Umra. Ibn `Umar said, ""Allah's Apostle did the same."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:                     I asked `Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). `Urwa replied, ""Aisha narrated, 'When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and his intention was not `Umra alone (but Hajj and `Umra together).' "" Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka`ba and it was not `Umra alone (but Hajj and `Umra together). And then `Umar did the same. Then `Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka`ba and it was not `Umra alone. And then Muawiya and `Abdullah bin `Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka`ba and it was not `Umra alone, (but Hajj and `Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not `Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn `Umar, and he did not do another `Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn `Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka`ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for `Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     I asked `Aisha : ""How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka`ba or performs `Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" `Aisha said, ""O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called ""Manat"" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" So Allah revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.' "" Aisha added, ""Surely, Allah's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them."" Later on I (`Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman (of `Aisha's narration) and he said, 'I have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom `Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur'an, the people asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka`ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Allah revealed: ""Verily As-Safa and Al- Marwa are among the symbols of Allah."" Abu Bakr said, ""It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka`ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka`ba.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar said, ""When Allah's Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka`ba), where as in performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rainwater passage,"" I asked Nafi`, ""Did `Abdullah (bin `Umar) use to walk steadily on reaching the Yemenite Corner?"" He replied, ""No, unless people were crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without touching it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Dinar:                     We asked Ibn `Umar whether a man who, while performing `Umra, had performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn `Umar replied ""The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka`ba and then offered a two-rak`at prayer behind Maqam Ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) between Safa and Marwa."" He added, ""Verily! In Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example."" We asked Jabir bin `Abdullah (the same question) and he said, ""He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Dinar:                     I heard Ibn `Umar saying, ""The Prophet arrived at Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and then offered a two-rak`at prayer and then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."" Ibn `Umar then recited (the verse): ""Verily! In Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example. """
Sarah,30," Narrated `Asim:                     I asked Anas bin Malik: ""Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?"" He said, ""Yes, as it was of the ceremonies of the days of the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance, till Allah revealed: 'Verily! (The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka`ba, or performs `Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.' "" (2.158)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and the Sa`i of Safa and Marwa so as to show his strength to the pagans.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah's Apostle about it. He replied, ""Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba till you get clean (from your menses)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. `Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. `Ali said, ""I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done."" The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the `Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka`ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, ""How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?"" When that news reached the Prophet he said, ""If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram."" `Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka`ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba. She said, ""O Allah's Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and `Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only."" So the Prophet ordered `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan`im and thus she performed the `Umra after the Hajj."
Sarah,30," Narrated Hafsa:                     (On `Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for `Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah's Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah's Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, ""We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients."" She (her sister) asked Allah's Apostle , ""Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn't have a veil?"" He said, ""She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers."" When Um 'Atiyya came, I asked her. ""Did you hear anything about that?"" Um 'Atiyya said, ""Bi Abi"" and she never mentioned the name of Allah's Apostle without saying ""Bi Abi"" (i.e. 'Let my father be sacrificed for you'). We asked her, ""Have you heard Allah's Apostle saying so and so (about women)?"" She replied in the affirmative and said, ""Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place)."" I asked her, ""The menstruating women?"" She replied, ""Don't they present themselves at `Arafat and at such and such places?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdul `Aziz bin Rufai:                     I asked Anas bin Malik, ""Tell me what you remember from Allah's Apostle (regarding these questions): Where did he offer the Zuhr and `Asr prayers on the day of Tarwiya (8th day of Dhul- Hijja)?"" He relied, ""(He offered these prayers) at Mina."" I asked, ""Where did he offer the `Asr prayer on the day of Nafr (i.e. departure from Mina on the 12th or 13th of Dhul-Hijja)?"" He replied, ""At Al- Abtah,"" and then added, ""You should do as your chiefs do."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdul `Aziz:                     I went out to Mina on the day of Tarwiya and met Anas going on a donkey. I asked him, ""Where did the Prophet offer the Zuhr prayer on this day?"" Anas replied, ""See where your chiefs pray and pray similarly."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle offered a two-rak`at prayer at Mina. Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman, (during the early years of his caliphate) followed the same practice."
Sarah,30, Narrated Haritha bin Wahab Al-Khuza`i:                     The Prophet led us in a two-rak`at prayer at Mina although our number was more than ever and we were in better security than ever.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     I offered (only a) two rak`at prayer with the Prophet (at Mina), and similarly with Abu Bakr and with `Umar, and then you d offered in opinions. Wish that I would be lucky enough to have two of the four rak`at accepted (by Allah)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Al-Fadl:                     The people doubted whether the Prophet was observing the fast on the Day of `Arafat, so I sent something for him to drink and he drank it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin Abu Bakr Al-Thaqafi:                     I asked Anas bin Malik while we were proceeding from Mina to `Arafat, ""What do you use to do on this day when you were with Allah's Apostle ?"" Anas said, ""Some of us used to recite Talbiya and nobody objected to that, and others used to recite Takbir and nobody objected to that."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     `Abdul Malik wrote to Al-Hajjaj that he should not differ from Ibn `Umar during Hajj. On the Day of `Arafat, when the sun declined at midday, Ibn `Umar came along with me and shouted near Al- Hajjaj's cotton (cloth) tent. Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, ""O Abu `Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?"" He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to `Arafat)."" Al-Hajjaj asked, ""At this very hour?"" Ibn `Umar said, ""Yes."" He replied, ""Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out."" Then Ibn `Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn `Umar). I said to him, ""If you want to follow the Sunna then deliver a brief sermon and hurry up for the stay at `Arafat."" He started looking at `Abdullah (Ibn `Umar) (inquiringly), and when `Abdullah noticed that, he said that he had told the truth."
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Al-Fadl bint Al Harith:                     On the day of `Arafat, some people who were with me, differed about the fasting of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) some said that he was fasting while others said that he was not fasting. So I sent a bowl full of milk to him while he was riding his camel, and he drank that milk."
Sarah,30," Ibn Shihab said:                      Salim said, ""In the year when Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf attacked Ibn Az-Zubair, the former asked 'Abdullah (Ibn 'Umar) what to do during the stay on the Day of 'Arafa (9th of Dhul-Hajjah). I said to him, ""If you want to follow the Sunna (the legal way of the Prophet ()) you should offer the Salat just after midday on the Day of the 'Arafa. 'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, 'He (Salim) has spoken the truth.' ""  They (the Companions of the Prophet ()) used to offer the Zuhr and Asr prayer together according to the Sunna, I asked Salim, ""Did Allah's Messenger () do that ?"" Salim said, ""And in doing that do you (people) follow anything else except his () Sunna?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     `Abdul-Malik bin Marwan wrote to Al-Hajjaj that he should follow `Abdullah bin `Umar in all the ceremonies of Hajj. So when it was the Day of `Arafat (9th of Dhul-Hijja), and after the sun has deviated or has declined from the middle of the sky, I and Ibn `Umar came and he shouted near the cotton (cloth) tent of Al-Hajjaj, ""Where is he?"" Al-Hajjaj came out. Ibn `Umar said, ""Let us proceed (to `Arafat)."" Al-Hajjaj asked, ""Just now?"" Ibn `Umar replied, ""Yes."" Al-Hajjaj said, ""Wait for me till I pour water on me (i.e. take a bath)."" So, Ibn `Umar dismounted (and waited) till Al-Hajjaj came out. He was walking between me and my father. I informed Al-Hajjaj, ""If you want to follow the Sunna today, then you should shorten the sermon and then hurry up for the stay (at `Arafat)."" Ibn `Umar said, ""He (Salim) has spoken the truth."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin Jubair bin Mut`im:                     My father said, ""(Before Islam) I was looking for my camel .."" The same narration is told by a different sub-narrator. Jubair bin Mut`im said, ""My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of `Arafat, and I saw the Prophet standing in `Arafat. I said to myself: By Allah he is from the Hums (literally: strictly religious, Quraish were called so, as they used to say, 'We are the people of Allah we shall not go out of the sanctuary). What has brought him here?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     During the Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance, the people used to perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba naked except the Hums; and the Hums were Quraish and their offspring. The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka`ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from `Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa. `Urwa added, ""My father narrated that `Aisha had said, 'The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence all the people depart--(2.199) `Urwa added, ""They (the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they were sent to `Arafat (by Allah's order)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     Usama was asked in my presence, ""How was the speed of (the camel of) Allah's Apostle while departing from `Arafat during the Hajjatul Wada`?"" Usama replied, ""The Prophet proceeded on with a modest pace, and when there was enough space he would (make his camel) go very fast."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Usama bin Zaid:                     As soon as the Prophet departed from `Arafat, he went towards the mountain pass, and there he answered the call of) the prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Will you offer the prayer here?"" He replied, ""(The place of) the prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar used to offer the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together at Jam' (Al-Muzdalifa). But he used to pass by that mountain pass where Allah's Apostle went, and he would enter it and answer the call of nature and perform ablution, and would not offer any prayer till he had prayed at Jam.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Usama bin Zaid:                     I rode behind Allah's Apostle from `Arafat and when Allah's Apostle reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Allah's Apostle!"" He replied, ""The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al- Muzdalifa)."" So Allah's Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin `Abbas) rode behind Allah's Apostle. Kuraib, (a sub-narrator) said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas narrated from Al-Fadl, ""Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the journey) till he reached the Jamra."" (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas.:                     I proceeded along with the Prophet on the day of `Arafat (9th Dhul-Hijja). The Prophet heard a great hue and cry and the beating of camels behind him. So he beckoned to the people with his lash, ""O people! Be quiet. Hastening is not a sign of righteousness."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Usama bin Zaid:                     Allah's Apostle proceeded from `Arafat and dismounted at the mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I said to him, ""(Shall we offer) the prayer?"" He replied, ""The prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)."" When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the (`Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between them (i.e. Maghrib and `Isha' prayers)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet offered the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together at Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) with a separate Iqama for each of them and did not offer any optional prayer in between them or after each of them.
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari:                     Allah's Apostle offered the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together at Al-Muzdalifa.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:                     `Abdullah;- performed the Hajj and we reached Al-Muzdalifa at or about the time of the `Isha' prayer. He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two rak`at after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the `Isha' prayer). (`Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement 'I think', was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by `Abdur-Rahman). Then `Abdullah offered two rak`at of `Isha' prayer. When the day dawned, `Abdullah said, ""The Prophet never offered any prayer at this hour except this prayer at this time and at this place and on this day."" `Abdullah added, ""These two prayers are shifted from their actual times -- the Maghrib prayer (is offered) when the people reached Al-Muzdalifa and the Fajr (morning) prayer at the early dawn."" `Abdullah added, ""I saw the Prophet doing that."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar used to send the weak among his family early to Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (that is Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Allah as much as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the Imam had started from Al- Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-Al- `Aqaba) Ibn `Umar used to say, ""Allah's Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle had sent me from Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) at night.
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I as among those whom the Prophet sent on the night of Al-Muzdalifa early being among the weak members of his family.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     (the slave of Asma') During the night of Jam', Asma' got down at Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the prayer for some time and then asked, ""O my son! Has the moon set?"" I replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then asked, ""Has the moon set?"" I replied, ""Yes."" So she said that we should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba) and then she returned to her dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, ""O you! I think we have come (to Mina) early in the night."" She replied, ""O my son! Allah's Apostle gave permission to the women to do so."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Sauda asked the permission of the Prophet to leave earlier at the night of Jam', and she was a fat and very slow woman. The Prophet gave her permission."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the Prophet to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al- Muzdalifa) before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till dawn, and set out with the Prophet but (I suffered so much that) I wished I had taken the permission of Allah's Apostle as Sauda had done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     I never saw the Prophet offering any prayer not at its stated time except two; he prayed the Maghrib and the `Isha' together and he offered the morning prayer before its usual time.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:                     I went out with `Abdullah , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the `Isha') together, making the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day dawned. Some people said, ""The day had dawned (at the time of the prayer),"" and others said, ""The day had not dawned."" `Abdullah then said, ""Allah's Apostle said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The Maghrib and the `Isha'. So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the `Isha' prayer has become due. The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' "" Then `Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, ""If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna."" I do not know which proceeded the other, his (`Abdullah's) statement or the departure of `Uthman . `Abdullah was reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the Jamrat-Al- `Aqaba on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th of Dhul-Hijja)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Maimun:                     I saw `Umar, offering the Fajr (morning) prayer at Jam'; then he got up and said, ""The pagans did not use to depart (from Jam') till the sun had risen, and they used to say, 'Let the sun shine on Thabir (a mountain).' But the Prophet contradicted them and departed from Jam' before sunrise."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet made Al-Fadl ride behind him, and Al-Fadl informed that he (the Prophet ) kept on reciting Talbiya till he did the Rami of the Jamra. (Jamrat-Al-`Aqaba.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah:                     Ibn `Abbas said, ""Usama bin Zaid rode behind the Prophet from `Arafat to Al-Muzdalifa; and then from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina, Al-Fadl rode behind him."" He added, ""Both of them (Usama and Al-Fadl) said, 'The Prophet was constantly reciting Talbiya till he did Rami of the Jamarat-Al-`Aqaba."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Jamra:                     I asked Ibn `Abbas about Hajj-at-Tamattu`. He ordered me to perform it. I asked him about the Hadi (sacrifice). He said, ""You have to slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hadi with the others."" It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu`). I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: ""Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-at-Tamattu`)"" I went to Ibn `Abbas and narrated it to him. He said, ""Allah is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. Prophet). Narrated Shu`ba that the call in the dream was. ""An accepted `Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira':                     Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) saw a man driving his Badana (sacrificial camel). He said, ""Ride on it."" The man said, ""It is a Badana."" The Prophet said, ""Ride on it."" He (the man) said, ""It is a Badana."" The Prophet said, ""Ride on it."" And on the second or the third time he (the Prophet ) added, ""Woe to you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet saw a man driving a Badana. He said, ""Ride on it."" The man replied, ""It is a Badana."" The Prophet said (again), ""Ride on it."" He (the man) said, ""It is a Badana."" The Prophet said thrice, ""Ride on it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada`) of Allah's Apostle he performed `Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah's Apostle started by assuming Ihram for `Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the `Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, ""Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka`ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka`ba, he offered a two rak`at prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah's Apostle did."
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Urwa:                      "" 'Aishah informed me about the Hajj and 'Umra (together) of the Prophet () and so did the people who were with him (during the Hajj and 'Umra) and narration similar to the narration of the Ibn 'Umar (previous hadith)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     `Abdullah (bin `Abdullah) bin `Umar said to his father, ""Stay here, for I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) might prevent you from reaching the Ka`ba."" Ibn `Umar said, ""(In this case) I would do the same as Allah's Apostle did, and Allah has said, 'Verily, in Allah's Apostle, you have a good example (to follow).' So, I make you, people, witness that I have made `Umra compulsory for me."" So he assumed lhram for `Umra. Then he went out and when he reached Al- Baida', he assumed Ihram for Hajj and `Umra (together) and said, ""The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and `Umra are the same."" He, then brought a Hadi from Qudaid. Then he arrived (at Mecca) and performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) once for both Hajj and `Umra and did not finish the lhram till he had finished both Hajj and `Umra."

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I twisted with my own hands the garlands for the Budn of the Prophet who garlanded and marked them, and then made them proceed to Mecca; Yet no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then."
Sarah,30," Narrated Hafsa:                     I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! What is wrong with the people, they have finished their Ihram but you have not?"" He said, ""I matted my hair and I have garlanded my Hadi, so I will not finish my Ihram till I finished my Hajj ."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to send the Hadi from Medina and I used to twist the garlands for his Hadi and he did not keep away from any of these things which a Muhrim keeps away from.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     I twisted the garlands for the Hadis of the Prophet and then he marked and garlanded them (or I garlanded them) and then made them proceed to the Ka`ba but he remained in Medina and no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then .

He replied, ""Verily, in Allah's Apostle there is a good example for you (to follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I make you witness that I have intended to perform `Umra."" When he reached Al-Baida', he said, ""The conditions for both Hajj and `Umra are the same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with `Umra."" After that he took a garlanded Hadi (to Mecca) which he bought (on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than that. He did not make legal for himself the things which were illegal for a Muhrim till it was the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his head shaved and slaughtered (the sacrifice) and considered sufficient his first Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa), as a (Sa`i) for his Hajj and `Umra both.

Sarah,30," Narrated Wabra:                     I asked Ibn `Umar, ""When should I do the Rami of the Jimar?"" He replied, ""When your leader does that."" I asked him again the same question. He replied, ""We used to wait till the sun declined and then we would do the Rami (i.e. on the 11th and 12th of Dhul-Hijja)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:                     `Abdullah, did the Rami from the middle of the valley. So, I said, ""O, Abu `Abdur-Rahman! Some people do the Rami (of the Jamra) from above it (i.e. from the top of the valley)."" He said, ""By Him except whom none has the right to be worshipped, this is the place from where the one on whom Surat-al-Baqara was revealed (i.e. Allah's Apostle) did the Rami."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:                     When `Abdullah, reached the big Jamra (i.e. Jamrat-ul-Aqaba) he kept the Ka`ba on the left side and Mina on his right side and threw seven pebbles (at the Jamra) and said, ""The one on whom Surat-al- Baqara was revealed (i.e. the Prophet) had done the Rami similarly."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid:                     I performed Hajj with Ibn Mas`ud , and saw him doing Rami of the big Jamra (Jamrat-ul-Aqaba) with seven small pebbles, keeping the Ka`ba on his left side and Mina on his right. He then said, ""This is the place where the one on whom Surat-al-Baqara was revealed (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) stood."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-A`mash:                     I heard Al-Hajjaj saying on the pulpit, ""The Sura in which Al-Baqara (the cow) is mentioned and the Sura in which the family of `Imran is mentioned and the Sura in which the women (An-Nisa) is mentioned."" I mentioned this to Ibrahim, and he said, `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid told me, 'I was with Ibn Mas`ud, when he did the Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba. He went down the middle of the valley, and when he came near the tree (which was near the Jamra) he stood opposite to it and threw seven small pebbles and said: 'Allahu-Akbar' on throwing every pebble.' Then he said, 'By Him, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, here (at this place) stood the one on whom Surat-al-Baqra was revealed (i.e. Allah's Apostle).' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     Ibn `Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya (the Jamra near to the Khaif mosque) with seven small stones and used to recite Takbir on throwing every pebble. He then would go ahead till he reached the level ground where he would stand facing the Qibla for a long time to invoke (Allah) while raising his hands (while invoking). Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta (middle Jamra) and then he would go to the left towards the middle ground, where he would stand facing the Qibla. He would remain standing there for a long period to invoke (Allah) while raising his hands, and would stand there for a long period. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba from the middle of the valley, but he would not stay by it, and then he would leave and say, ""I saw the Prophet doing like this."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim bin `Abdullah:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar used to do Rami of the Jamrat-ud-Dunya with seven small pebbles and used to recite Takbir on throwing each stone. He, then, would proceed further till he reached the level ground, where he would stay for a long time, facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Wusta similarly and would go to the left towards the level ground, where he would stand for a long time facing the Qibla to invoke (Allah) while raising his hands. Then he would do Rami of the Jamrat-ul-Aqaba from the middle of the valley, but he would not stay by it. Ibn `Umar used to say, ""I saw Allah's Apostle doing like that."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zuhri:                      Whenever Allah's Messenger () stoned the Jamra near Mina Mosque, he would do Ramy of it with seven small pebbles and say Takbir on throwing each pebble. Then he would go ahead and stand facing the Qiblah with his hands raised, and invoke (Allah) and he sued to stand for a long period. Then he would come to the second Jamra (Al-Wusta) and stone it will seven small stones, reciting Takbir on throwing each stone. Then he would stand facing the Qiblah with raised hands to invoke (Allah). Then he would come to the Jamra near the 'Aqaba (Jamrat-ul-'Aqaba) and do Ramy of it with seven small pebbles, reciting Takbir on throwing each stone. he then would leave and not stay by it. Narrated Az-Zuhri: I heard Salim bin 'Abdullah saying the same that his father said on the authority of the Prophet (saw). And Ibn 'Umar used to do the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim:                     I heard my father who was the best man of his age, saying, ""I heard `Aisha saying, 'I perfumed Allah's Apostle with my own hands before finishing his Ihram while yet he has not performed Tawaf-al- Ifada.' She spread her hands (while saying so.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The people were ordered to perform the Tawaf of the Ka`ba (Tawaf-al-Wada`) as the lastly thing, before leaving (Mecca), except the menstruating women who were excused."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet offered the Zuhr, `Asr, Maghrib and the `Isha' prayers and slept for a while at a place called Al-Muhassab and then rode to the Ka`ba and performed Tawaf round it ."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Safiya bint Huyay, the wife of the Prophet got her menses, and Allah's Apostle was informed of that. He said, ""Would she delay us?"" The people said, ""She has already performed Tawaf-al-Ifada."" He said, ""Therefore she will not (delay us)."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ikrima:                     The people of Medina asked Ibn `Abbas about a woman who got her menses after performing Tawafal- Ifada. He said, ""She could depart (from Mecca)."" They said, ""We will not act on your verdict and ignore the verdict of Zaid."" Ibn `Abbas said, ""When you reach Medina, inquire about it."" So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One of those whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of Safiya (812)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     A menstruating woman was allowed to leave Mecca if she had done Tawaf-al-Ifada. Tawus (a subnarrator) said from his father, ""I heard Ibn `Umar saying that she would not depart. Then later I heard him saying that the Prophet had allowed them (menstruating women) to depart."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka`ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and `Umra except me."" He asked me, ""Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka`ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?"" I said, ""No."" He said, ""Go to Tan`im with your brother `Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for `Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place."" So I went with `Abdur-Rahman to Tan`im and assumed Ihram for `Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, "" 'Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn't you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?"" She said, ""Yes, I did."" He said, ""Then there is no harm, depart."" So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdul-Aziz bin Rufai:                     I asked Anas bin Malik, ""Tell me something you have observed about the Prophet concerning where he offered the Zuhr prayer on the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja)."" Anas replied, ""He offered it at Mina."" I said, ""Where did he offer the `Asr prayer on the Day of Nafr (day of departure from Mina)?"" He replied, ""At Al-Abtah,"" and added, ""You should do as your leaders do."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet offered the Zuhr, `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha' prayers and slept for a while at a place called Al-Mahassab and then he rode towards the Ka`ba and performed Tawaf (al-Wada`)."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     It (i.e. Al-Abtah) was a place where the Prophet used to camp so that it might be easier for him to depart.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Staying at Al-Mahassab is not one of the ceremonies (of Hajj), but Al-Mahassab is a place where Allah's Apostle camped (during his Hajjat-al-Wida)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or `Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka`ba seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking in the last four. On finishing, he would offer two rak`at prayer and set out to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to his dwelling place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or `Umra, he used to make his camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at Dhul-Hulaifa, the place where the Prophet used to make his camel kneel down."
Sarah,30," Narrated Khalid bin Al-Harith:                     'Ubaidullah was asked about Al Mahassab. 'Ubaidullah narrated: Nafi` said, 'Allah's Apostles, `Umar and Ibn `Umar camped there."" Nafi` added, ""Ibn `Umar used to offer the Zuhr and `Asr prayers at it (i.e. Al-Mahassab)."" I think he mentioned the Maghrib prayer also. I said, ""I don't doubt about `Isha' (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while. He used to say, 'The Prophet used to do the same.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi':                      Whenver Ibn 'Umar (ra) approached (Makkah) he used to pass the night at Dhi-Tuwa till dawn, and then he would enter Makkah. On his return, he used to pass by Dhi-Tuwa and pass the night there till dawn, and he used to say that the Prophet () used to do the same."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn ' `Abbas:                     Dhul-Majaz and `Ukaz were the markets of the people during the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance. When the people embraced Islam, they disliked to do bargaining there till the following Holy Verses were revealed:-- There is no harm for you If you seek of the bounty Of your Lord (during Hajj by trading, etc.) (2.198)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Safiya got her menses on the night of Nafr (departure from Hajj), and she said, ""I see that I will detain you."" The Prophet said, ""Aqra Halqa! Did she perform the Tawaf on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?"" Somebody replied in the affirmative. He said, ""Then depart."" (Different narrators mentioned that) `Aisha said, ""We set out with Allah''s Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, ""Halqa Aqra! I think that she will detain you,"" and added, ""Did you perform the Tawaf (Al-Ifada) on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?"" She replied, ""Yes."" He said, ""Then depart."" I said, ""O Allah''s Apostle! I have not (done the Umra)."" He replied, ""Perform `Umra from Tan`im."" My brother went with me and we came across the Prophet in the last part of the night. He said, ""Wait at such and such a place."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""(The performance of) `Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Juraij:                     `Ikrima bin Khalid asked Ibn `Umar about performing `Umra before Hajj. Ibn `Umar replied, ""There is no harm in it."" `Ikrima said, ""Ibn `Umar also said, 'The Prophet had performed `Umra before performing Hajj.'"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ikrima bin Khalid:                     ""I asked Ibn `Umar the same (as above)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mujahid:                     Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw `Abdullah bin `Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Urwa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed `Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab."" We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard `Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, ""O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don't you hear what Abu `Abdur Rahman is saying?"" She said, ""What does he say?"" 'Urwa said, ""He says that Allah's Apostle performed four `Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab."" `Aisha said, ""May Allah be merciful to Abu `Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any `Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any `Umra in Rajab."""
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Ursa bin Az-Zubair:                     I asked `Aisha (whether the Prophet had performed `Umra in Rajab). She replied, ""Allah's Apostle never performed any `Umra in Rajab."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Qatada:                     I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed `Umra. He replied, ""Four times. 1. `Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa'da when the pagans hindered him; 2. `Umra in the following year in Dhi-l- Qa'da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. `Umra from Al-Ja'rana where he distributed the war booty."" I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, ""How many times did he perform Hajj?"" He (Anas) replied, ""Once. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Qatada:                     I asked Anas (about the Prophet's `Umra) and he replied, ""The Prophet performed `Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another `Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da, and another `Umra in combination with his Hajj."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Hammam:                     The Prophet performed four `Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa'da except the (one) `Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His `Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al- Jr'rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another `Umra with his Hajj."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu 'Is-haq:                     I asked Masruq, `Ata' and Mujahid (about the `Umra of Allah's Apostle). They said, ""Allah's Apostle had performed `Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da before he performed Hajj."" I heard Al-Bara' bin `Azib saying, ""Allah's Apostle had performed `Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da twice before he performed Hajj."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ata:                     I heard Ibn `Abbas saying, ""Allah's Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn `Abbas named her but `Ata' forgot her name), 'What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?' She replied, 'We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.' He said (to her), 'Perform `Umra when Ramadan comes, for `Umra in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward),' or said something similar."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     We set out along with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, ""Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for `Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for `Umra."" (`Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for `Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for `Umra. The day of `Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, ""Abandon your `Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;."" When it was the night of Hasba, he sent `Abdur Rahman with me to at-Tan`im and I assumed Ihram for `Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed `Umra."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Amr bin Aus:                     `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let `Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform `Umra from at-Tan`im.
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. `Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (`Ali) said, ""I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah's Apostle has assumed it."" The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for `Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka`ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, ""Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?"" The Prophet heard that and said, ""Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram."" `Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba, she said, ""O Allah's Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and `Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!"" So, he ordered `Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to at-Tan`im. Thus she performed `Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham met the Prophet at Al-`Aqaba (Jamrat-ul 'Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?"" The Prophet replied, ""No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform `Umra before Hajj."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We set out with Allah's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said, ""Whoever wants to assume Ihram for `Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for `Umra."" Some of the people assumed Ihram for `Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for `Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of `Arafat. I complained to Allah's Apostle about it, he said, ""Abandon your `Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj."" So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent `Abdur Rahman with me to at-Tan`im. The sub-narrator adds: He (`Abdur-Rahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for `Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and `Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     That `Aisha said, ""O Allah's Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and `Umra) but I am returning with one only?"" He said, ""Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to at-Tan`im, assume Ihram (and after performing `Umra) join us at such-andsuch a place. But it (i.e. the reward if `Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, ""Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as `Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it."" The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the `Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, ""I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the `Umra."" He asked me, ""What is the matter with you?"" I replied, ""I am not praying."" He said, ""There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the `Umra as well."" So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called `Abdur- Rahman and said, ""Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for `Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place."" We came back at midnight and the Prophet asked us, ""Have you finished?"" I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina."
Sarah,30," Narrated Safwan bin Ya`la bin Umaiya from his father who said:                     ""A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to perform in my `Umra?' So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. `Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?' I replied in the affirmative. `Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, ""Where is the questioner who asked about `Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka`ba and the Sa`i between Safa and Marwa). """
Sarah,30," Narrated Hisham Ibn `Urwa from his father who said:                     While I was a youngster, I asked `Aisha the wife of the Prophet. ""What about the meaning of the Statement of Allah; ""Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or `Umra of the House (Ka`ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them."" `Aisha replied, ""No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: 'It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.' This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As- Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah's Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:-- ""Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or `Umra of the House (Ka`ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them."" (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from `Aisha): ""The Hajj or `Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah's sight."
Sarah,30," Narrated Isma`il:                     `Abdullah bin Abu `Aufa said: ""Allah's Apostle performed `Umra and we too performed `Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka`ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow."" A friend of his asked him (i.e. `Abdullah bin `Aufa), ""Did the Prophet enter the Ka`ba (during that `Umra)?"" He replied in the negative. Then he said, ""What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?"" He (Abdullah bin `Aufa) said, ""(He said) 'Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Dinar:                     We asked Ibn `Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka`ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, ""The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka`ba seven times and then offered a two rak`at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah's Apostle you have a good example."" And we asked Jabir bin `Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, ""He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari:                     I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha' while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, ""Have you intended to perform the Hajj?"" I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, 'With what intention have you assumed Ihram?"" I replied, ""I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, ""You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka`ba and (the Sai) between As-Safa and Al- Marwa and then finish the Ihram."" So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka`ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of `Umar who said, ""If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     `Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asma', whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, ""May Allah bless His Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, `Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed `Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka`ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka`ba and between As-Safa and Al- Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or `Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, ""None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (nonbelievers)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     When the Prophet arrived at Mecca, some boys of the tribe of Bani `Abdul Muttalib went to receive him, and the Prophet made one of them ride in front of him and the other behind him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle left for Mecca, he used to pray in the mosque of Ash-Shajra, and when he returned (to Medina), he used to pray in the middle of the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa and used to pass the night there till morning."
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet never returned to his family from a journey at night. He used to return either in the morning or in the afternoon.
Sarah,30, Narrated Jabir:                     The Prophet forbade going to one's family at night (on arrival from a journey).
Sarah,30," Narrated Humaid:                     Anas said, ""Whenever Allah's Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster."" Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     As above, but mentioned ""the walls of Medina"" instead of ""the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin `Umar agrees with Anas."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu 'Is-haq:                     I heard Al-Bara' saying, ""The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: -- ""It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors."" (2.189)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one's needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one's family."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:                     I was with Ibn `Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers together. Then he said, ""I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the `Isha prayers together)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     When `Abdullah bin `Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, ""If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka`ba, then I would do the same as Allah's Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah's Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     That Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah and Salim bin `Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn `Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying ""There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Ka`ba."" Ibn `Umar said ""We set out with Allah's Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka`ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved."" Ibn `Umar added, ""I make you witnesses that I have made `Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka`ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka`ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company."" Ibn `Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, ""The conditions of `Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made `Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself."" So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, ""I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both `Umra and Hajj)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Nafi`:                     Some of the sons of `Abdullah told him (i.e. `Abdullah) if he had stayed (and not performed Hajj that year).
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle was prevented from performing (`Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year."
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     (Abdullah) bin `Umar used to say, ""Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah's Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka`ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Al-Miswar:                     Allah's Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     That `Abdullah and Salim said to `Abdullah bin `Umar, ""(You should not go for Hajj this year)."" `Abdullah bin `Umar replied, ""We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing `Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka`ba. Allah's Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     When `Abdullah bin `Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing `Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, ""If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka`ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah's Apostle ."" So, he assumed the Ihram for `Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for `Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then `Abdullah bin `Umar thought about it and said, ""The conditions for both Hajj and `Umra are similar."" He then turned towards his companions and said, ""The conditions of both Hajj and `Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with `Umra."" He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (`Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:                     Ka`b bin 'Ujra said that Allah's Apostle said to him (Ka`b), ""Perhaps your lice have troubled you?"" Ka`b replied, ""Yes! O Allah's Apostle."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ka`b bin `Umra:                     Allah's Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, ""Have your lice troubled you?"" I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka`b added, ""This Holy Verse:--'And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. ""The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc. (sacrifice) whatever was available."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Ma'qal:                     I sat with Ka`b bin 'Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, ""This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah's Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, ""I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?"" I replied in the negative. He then said, ""Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food."" (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:                     (Reporting the speech of Ka`b bin Umra) Allah's Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka`b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), ""Have your lice troubled you?"" He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah's Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ka'b bin 'Ujra (ra):                      Allah's Messenger () saw him (i.e. Ka'b) while the lice were falling on his face.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka`ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newlyborn child. (Just delivered by his mother)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever performs Hajj to this Ka`ba and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commit sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newborn child, (just delivered by his mother)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:                     My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), ""I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, ""Where did you leave the Prophet ?"" He replied, ""I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah's Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O Allah's Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:                     That his father said ""We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah's Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah's Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah's Apostle till I reached him and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah's Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them."" So he did. Then I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over."" Allah's Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Qatada:                     We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, ""We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram."" So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, ""Eat it."" While some others said, ""Do not eat it."" So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, ""Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:                     That his father had told him that Allah's Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, ""Proceed along the seashore till we meet all together."" So, they took the route of the seashore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a sheonager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: ""How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?"" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's meat, and when they met Allah's Apostle they asked, saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), 'How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?' So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, ""Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?"" They replied in the negative. He said, ""Then eat what is left of its meat."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     From As-Sa'b bin Jath-thama Al-Laithi that the latter presented an onager to Allah's Apostle while he was at Al-Abwa' or at Waddan, and he refused it. On noticing the signs of some unpleasant feeling of disappointment on his (As-Sab's) face, the Prophet said to him, ""I have only returned it because I am Muhrim."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""It is not sinful of a Muhrim to kill five kinds of animals."""
Sarah,30," One of the wives of the Prophet narrated:                     The Prophet said, ""A Muhrim can kill (five kinds of animals.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Hafsa:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""It is not sinful (of a Muhrim) to kill five kinds of animals, namely: the crow, the kite, the mouse, the scorpion and the rabid dog."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Five kinds of animals are harmful and could be killed in the Haram (Sanctuary). These are: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     While we were in the company of the Prophet in a cave at Mina, when Surat-wal-Mursalat were revealed and he recited it and I heard it (directly) from his mouth as soon as he recited its revelation. Suddenly a snake sprang at us and the Prophet said (ordered us): ""Kill it."" We ran to kill it but it escaped quickly. The Prophet said, ""It has escaped your evil and you too have escaped its evil."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha the wife of the Prophet:                     Allah's Apostle called the salamander a bad animal, but I did not hear him ordering it to be killed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Abu Sa`id Al-Maqburi:                     Abu Shuraih, Al-`Adawi said that he had said to `Amr bin Sa`id when he was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), ""O Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah's Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, 'Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah's Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, 'Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' ""Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact."" Abu Shuraih was asked, ""What did `Amr reply?"" He said, (`Amr said) 'O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     ""The Prophet said, 'Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.' Al-`Abbas said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet then said, 'Except Al-Idhkhir.' "" `Ikrima said, 'Do you know what ""chasing or disturbing"" the game means? It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     On the day of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet said, ""There is no more emigration (from Mecca) but Jihad and intentions, and whenever you are called for Jihad, you should go immediately. No doubt, Allah has made this place (Mecca) a sanctuary since the creation of the heavens and the earth and will remain a sanctuary till the Day of Resurrection as Allah has ordained its sanctity. Fighting was not permissible in it for anyone before me, and even for me it was allowed only for a portion of a day. So, it is a sanctuary with Allah's sanctity till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns should not be uprooted and its game should not be chased; and its luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by one who would announce that publicly, and its vegetation (grass etc.) should not be cut."" Al-`Abbas said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir, (for it is used by their blacksmiths and for their domestic purposes)."" So, the Prophet said, ""Except Al-Idhkhir."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle was cupped while he was in a state of Ihram.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Buhaina:                     The Prophet, while in the state of Ihram, was cupped at the middle of his head at Liha-Jamal."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet married Maimuna while he was in the state of Ihram, (only the ceremonies of marriage were held)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     A person stood up and asked, ""O Allah's: Apostle! What clothes may be worn in the state of Ihram?"" The Prophet replied, ""Do not wear a shirt or trousers, or any headgear (e.g. a turban), or a hooded cloak; but if somebody has no shoes he can wear leather stockings provided they are cut short off the ankles, and also, do not wear anything perfumed with Wars or saffron, and the Muhrima (a woman in the state of Ihram) should not cover her face, or wear gloves."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     A man was crushed to death by his she-camel and was brought to Allah's Apostle who said, ""Give him a bath and shroud him, but do not cover his head, and do not bring any perfume near to him, as he will be resurrected reciting Talbiya."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Hunain:                     `Abdullah bin Al-Abbas and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama differed at Al-Abwa'; Ibn `Abbas said that a Muhrim could wash his head; while Al-Miswar maintained that he should not do so. `Abdullah bin `Abbas sent me to Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari and I found him bathing between the two wooden posts (of the well) and was screened with a sheet of cloth. I greeted him and he asked who I was. I replied, ""I am `Abdullah bin Hunain and I have been sent to you by Ibn `Abbas to ask you how Allah's Apostle used to wash his head while in the state of lhram."" Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari caught hold of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on his head. He poured water on his head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head with his hands by bringing them from back to front and from front to back and said, ""I saw the Prophet doing like this."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon at `Arafat saying, ""If a Muhrim does not find slippers, he could wear Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather, but he has to cut short the Khuffs below the ankles), and if he does not find an Izar (a waist sheet for wrapping the lower half of the body) he could wear trousers."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     Allah's Apostle was asked what sort of clothes a Muhrim should wear. He replied, ""He should not wear a shirt, turbans, trousers, a hooded cloak, or a dress perfumed with saffron or Wars; and if slippers are not available he can wear Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather) but he should cut them so that they reach below the ankles."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet delivered a sermon at `Arafat and said, ""Whoever does not get an Izar can wear trousers, and whoever cannot get a pair of shoes can wear Khuffs (socks made from thick fabric or leather)."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Al-Bara:                     The Prophet assumed Ihram for Umra in the month of Dhul-Qa'da but the (pagan) people of Mecca refused to admit him into Mecca till he agreed on the condition that he would not bring into Mecca any arms but sheathed.
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat (the place for assuming Ihram) for the people of Medina, and Qaran-al-Manazil for the people of Najd, and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. These Mawaqit are for those people and also for those who come through these Mawaqit (from places other than the above-mentioned) with the intention of (performing) Hajj and Umra. And those living inside these Mawaqit can assume Ihram from the place where they start; even the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle entered Mecca in the year of its Conquest wearing an Arabian helmet on his head and when the Prophet took it off, a person came and said, ""Ibn Khatal is holding the covering of the Ka`ba (taking refuge in the Ka`ba)."" The Prophet said, ""Kill him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ya'li:                     While I was with Allah's Apostle there came to him a man wearing a cloak having a trace of yellowish perfume or a similar thing on it. `Umar used to say to me, ""Would you like to see the Prophet at the time when he is inspired divinely?"" So, it happened that he was inspired (then) and when the inspiration was over the Prophet said (to that man), ""Do in your `Umra the same as you do in your Hajj."""

And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: ""Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of goodsmelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!"" The Prophet said, ""O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi`a and `Utba bin Rabi`a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics."" Allah's Apostle then said, ""O Allah!

The bedouin further asked, ""Inform me what Allah has made compulsory for me as regards fasting."" He replied, ""You have to fast during the whole month of Ramadan, unless you want to fast more as Nawafil."" The bedouin further asked, ""Tell me how much Zakat Allah has enjoined on me."" Thus, Allah's Apostle informed him about all the rules (i.e. fundamentals) of Islam. The bedouin then said, ""By Him Who has honored you, I will neither perform any Nawafil nor will I decrease what Allah has enjoined on me.

The Prophet added, ""By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk.

Hudhaifa replied, ""There is a closed gate in front of those afflictions."" `Umar asked, ""Will that gate be opened or broken?"" He replied, ""It will be broken."" `Umar said, ""Then the gate will not be closed again till the Day of Resurrection."" We said to Masruq, ""Would you ask Hudhaifa whether `Umar knew what that gate symbolized?"" He asked him and he replied ""He (`Umar) knew it as one knows that there will be night before tomorrow, morning."

Here is prosperity.' So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers, will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was amongst the people who used to participate in Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad; and whoever was amongst those who used to observe fasts, will be called from the gate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called from the gate of charity."" Abu Bakr said, ""Let my parents be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will be called from those gates.

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet was the most generous amongst the people, and he used to be more so in the month of Ramadan when Gabriel visited him, and Gabriel used to meet him on every night of Ramadan till the end of the month. The Prophet used to recite the Holy Qur'an to Gabriel, and when Gabriel met him, he used to be more generous than a fast wind (which causes rain and welfare)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions, Allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink (i.e. Allah will not accept his fasting.)"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Allah said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons (people) are for them, except fasting which is for Me, and I will give the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk.

Someone said to him ""You vowed that you would not go to your wives for one month."" He replied, ""The month is of 29 days."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Allah's Apostle vowed to keep aloof from his wives for one month, and he had dislocation of his leg.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""None of you should fast a day or two before the month of Ramadan unless he has the habit of fasting (Nawafil) (and if his fasting coincides with that day) then he can fast that day."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     It was the custom among the companions of Muhammad that if any of them was fasting and the food was presented (for breaking his fast), but he slept before eating, he would not eat that night and the following day till sunset. Qais bin Sirma-al-Ansari was fasting and came to his wife at the time of Iftar (breaking one's fast) and asked her whether she had anything to eat. She replied, ""No, but I would go and bring some for you."" He used to do hard work during the day, so he was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. When his wife came and saw him, she said, ""Disappointment for you."" When it was midday on the following day, he fainted and the Prophet was informed about the whole matter and the following verses were revealed: ""You are permitted To go to your wives (for sexual relation) At the night of fasting."" So, they were overjoyed by it. And then Allah also revealed: ""And eat and drink Until the white thread Of dawn appears to you Distinct from the black thread (of the night)."" (2.187)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Adi bin Hatim:                     When the above verses were revealed: 'Until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the black thread,' I took two (hair) strings, one black and the other white, and kept them under my pillow and went on looking at them throughout the night but could not make anything out of it. So, the next morning I went to Allah's Apostle and told him the whole story. He explained to me, ""That verse means the darkness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Saud:                     When the following verses were revealed: 'Eat and drink until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the black thread' and of dawn was not revealed, some people who intended to fast, tied black and white threads to their legs and went on eating till they differentiated between the two.

So, when the people refused to stop Al-Wisal (fasting continuously), the Prophet fasted day and night continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then they saw the crescent moon (of the month of Shawwal).

She replied, ""Your brother Abu Ad-Darda' is not interested in (the luxuries of) this world."" In the meantime Abu Ad-Darda' came and prepared a meal for Salman. Salman requested Abu Ad- Darda' to eat (with him), but Abu Ad-Darda' said, ""I am fasting."" Salman said, ""I am not going to eat unless you eat."" So, Abu Ad-Darda' ate (with Salman). When it was night and (a part of the night passed), Abu Ad-Darda' got up (to offer the night prayer), but Salman told him to sleep and Abu Ad- Darda' slept. After sometime Abu Ad-Darda' again got up but Salman told him to sleep. When it was the last hours of the night, Salman told him to get up then, and both of them offered the prayer. Salman told Abu Ad-Darda', ""Your Lord has a right on you, your soul has a right on you, and your family has a right on you; so you should give the rights of all those who has a right on you.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet never fasted a full month except the month of Ramadan, and he used to fast till one could say, ""By Allah, he will never stop fasting,"" and he would abandon fasting till one would say, ""By Allah, he will never fast."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Allah's Apostle used to leave fasting in a certain month till we thought that he would not fast in that month, and he used to fast in another month till we thought he would not stop fasting at all in that month. And if one wanted to see him praying at night, one could see him (in that condition), and if one wanted to see him sleeping at night, one could see him (in that condition) too."
Sarah,30," Narrated Humaid:                     I asked Anas about the fasting of the Prophet. He said ""Whenever I liked to see the Prophet fasting in any month, I could see that, and whenever I liked to see him not fasting, I could see that too, and if I liked to see him praying in any night, I could see that, and if I liked to see him sleeping, I could see that, too.""

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As:                     ""Once Allah's Apostle came to me,"" and then he narrated the whole narration, i.e. your guest has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you. I then asked about the fasting of David. The Prophet replied, ""Half of the year,"" (i.e. he used to fast on every alternate day)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As:                     Allah's Apostle said to me, ""O `Abdullah! Have I not been informed that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night."" `Abdullah replied, ""Yes, O Allah's Apostle!"" The Prophet said, ""Don't do that; fast for few days and then give it up for few days, offer prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you. And it is sufficient for you to fast three days in a month, as the reward of a good deed is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting throughout the year."" I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have power."" The Prophet said, ""Fast like the fasting of the Prophet David and do not fast more than that."" I said, ""How was the fasting of the Prophet of Allah, David?"" He said, ""Half of the year,"" (i.e. he used to fast on every alternate day). Afterwards when `Abdullah became old, he used to say, ""It would have been better for me if I had accepted the permission of the Prophet (which he gave me i.e. to fast only three days a month)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:                     Allah's Apostle was informed that I had taken an oath to fast daily and to pray (every night) all the night throughout my life (so Allah's Apostle came to me and asked whether it was correct): I replied, ""Let my parents be sacrificed for you! I said so."" The Prophet said, ""You can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, r ray and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting."" I replied, ""I can do better than that."" The Prophet said to me, ""Fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of Prophet David and that is the best fasting."" I said, ""I have the power to fast better (more) than that."" The Prophet said, ""There is no better fasting than that."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:                     The news of my daily fasting and praying every night throughout the night reached the Prophet. So he sent for me or I met him, and he said, ""I have been informed that you fast everyday and pray every night (all the night). Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days); pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you."" I replied, ""I have more power than that (fasting)."" The Prophet said, ""Then fast like the fasts of (the Prophet) David"". I said, ""How?"" He replied, ""He used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy."" I said, ""From where can I get that chance?"" (`Ata' said, ""I do not know how the expression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred."") So, the Prophet said, twice, ""Whoever fasts daily throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Mujahid from `Abdullah bin `Amr:                     The Prophet said (to `Abdullah), ""Fast three days a month."" `Abdullah said, (to the Prophet) ""I am able to fast more than that."" They kept on arguing on this matter till the Prophet said, ""Fast on alternate days, and recite the whole Qur'an once a month."" `Abdullah said, ""I can recite more (in a month),"" and the argument went on till the Prophet said, ""Recite the Qur'an once each three days."" (i.e. you must not recite the whole Qur'an in less than three days)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As:                     The Prophet said to me, ""You fast daily all the year and pray every night all the night?"" I replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, ""If you keep on doing this, your eyes will become weak and your body will get tired. He who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at all. The fasting of three days (a month) will be equal to the tasting of the whole year."" I replied, ""I have the power for more than this."" The Prophet said, ""Then fast like the fasting of David who used to fast on alternate days and would never flee from the battle field, on meeting the enemy."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr:                     Allah's Apostle was informed about my fasts, and he came to me and I spread for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fires, but he sat on the ground and the cushion remained between me and him, and then he said, ""Isn't it sufficient for you to fast three days a month?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Five?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Seven?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)."" He said, ""Nine (days per month)?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! (I can fast more)"" He said, ""Eleven (days per month)?"" And then the Prophet said, ""There is no fast superior to that of the Prophet David it was for half of the year. So, fast on alternate days."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     My friend (the Prophet ) advised me to observe three things: (1) to fast three days a month; (2) to pray two rak`at of Duha prayer (forenoon prayer); and (3) to pray witr before sleeping.
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet paid a visit to Um-Sulaim and she placed before him dates and ghee. The Prophet said, ""Replace the ghee and dates in their respective containers for I am fasting."" Then he stood somewhere in her house and offered an optional prayer and then he invoked good on Um-Sulaim and her family. Then Um-Sulaim said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have a special request (today)."" He said, ""What is it?"" She replied, ""(Please invoke for) your servant Anas."" So Allah's Apostle did not leave anything good in the world or the Hereafter which he did not invoke (Allah to bestow) on me and said, ""O Allah! Give him (i.e. Anas) property and children and bless him."" Thus I am one of the richest among the Ansar and my daughter Umaina told me that when Al-Hajjaj came to Basra, more than 120 of my offspring had been buried."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mutarrif from `Imran Ibn Husain:                     That the Prophet asked him (Imran) or asked a man and `Imran was listening, ""O Abu so-and-so! Have you fasted the last days of this month?"" (The narrator thought that he said, ""the month of Ramadan""). The man replied, ""No, O Allah's Apostle!""

Sarah,30," Narrated Maimuna:                     The people doubted whether the Prophet was fasting on the day of `Arafat or not, so I sent milk while he was standing at `Arafat, he drank it and the people were looking at him."

Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Quraish used to fast on the day of 'Ashura' in the Pre-Islamic period, and Allah's Apostle too, used to fast on that day.

Later when the fasting of the month of Ramadan was prescribed, he gave up fasting on the day of 'Ashura' and it became optional for one to fast on it or not."

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet came to Medina and saw the Jews fasting on the day of Ashura. He asked them about that. They replied, ""This is a good day, the day on which Allah rescued Bani Israel from their enemy. So, Moses fasted this day."" The Prophet said, ""We have more claim over Moses than you."" So, the Prophet fasted on that day and ordered (the Muslims) to fast (on that day)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The day of 'Ashura' was considered as `Id day by the Jews. So the Prophet ordered, ""I recommend you (Muslims) to fast on this day."""

Sarah,30," 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abdul Qari said,""I went out in the company of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramadan to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, 'Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, 'Umar remarked, 'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night."""

In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Allah's Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, ""Amma ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on."" So, Allah's Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Salama bin `Abdur Rahman:                     that he asked `Aisha ""How was the prayer of Allah's Apostle in Ramadan?"" She replied, ""He did not pray more than eleven rak`at in Ramadan or in any other month. He used to pray four rak`at ---- let alone their beauty and length----and then he would pray four ----let alone their beauty and length ---- and then he would pray three rak`at (witr)."" She added, ""I asked, 'O Allah's Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the witr?' He replied, 'O `Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Salama:                     I asked Abu Sa`id, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, ""We practiced I`tikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramadan with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramadan, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in I`tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks.

Once in Ramadan, in which he practiced I`tikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Allah wished him to order and said, ""I used to practice I`tikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle third but now I intend to stay in I`tikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in I`tikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion.

I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water."" On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet .

Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, the Prophet used to tighten his waist belt (i.e. work hard) and used to pray all the night, and used to keep his family awake for the prayers."

The Prophet said, ""Whoever was in I`tikaf with me should stay in I`tikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.""

Hafsa asked the permission of `Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?"" He was told of the whole situation.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali bin Al-Husain:                     Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah's Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah's Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, ""She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai."" Both of them said, ""Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah's Apostle!"" And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), ""Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one's body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman:                     I asked Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri, ""Did you hear Allah's Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?"" He replied in the affirmative and said, ""Once we were in I`tikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah's Apostledelivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, 'I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in I`tikaf with Allah's Apostle should return for it.' The people returned to the mosque (for I`tikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah's Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet."

The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, ""Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai."" They replied, ""Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah's Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you)."" The Prophet replied, ""Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:                     Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in I`tikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, ""Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, ""This is Safiya""). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam's offspring as his blood circulates in it."" (A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, ""Did Safiya visit him at night?"" He said, ""Of course, at night."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     We practiced I`tikaf with Allah's Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah's Apostle came to us and said, ""Whoever was m I`tikaf should return to his place of I`tikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water."" When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leafstalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amra bint `Abdur-Rahman from `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to practice I`tikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his I`tikaf. `Aisha asked his permission to let her practice I`tikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah's Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, ""What is this?"" He was informed about it. He then said, ""What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them."" So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform I`tikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-Islamic period to perform I`tikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night."" The Prophet said, ""Fulfill your vow."" So, he performed I`tikaf for one night."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     that `Umar had vowed in the Pre-Islamic period to perform I`tikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A subnarrator thinks that `Umar vowed to perform I`tikaf for one night.) Allah's Apostle said to `Umar, ""Fulfill your vow."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet used to perform I`tikaf every year in the month of Ramadan for ten days, and when it was the year of his death, he stayed in I`tikaf for twenty days."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amra bint `Abdur-Rahman from `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle mentioned that he would practice I`tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. `Aisha asked his permission to perform I`tikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked `Aisha to take his permission for her, and she did so. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw that, she ordered a tent to be pitched for her and it was pitched for her. Allah's Apostle used to proceed to his tent after the prayer. So, he saw the tents ans asked, ""What is this?"" He was told that those were the tents of Aisha, Hafsa, and Zainab. Allah's Apostle said, ""Is it righteousness which they intended by doing so? I am not going to perform I`tikaf."" So he returned home. When the fasting month was over, he performed Itikar for ten days in the month of Shawwal."
Sarah,30, Narrated `Urwa:                     Aisha during her menses used to comb and oil the hair of the Prophet while he used to be in I`tikaf in the mosque. He would stretch out his head towards her while she was in her chamber.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Allah's Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from Allah's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I used to stick to Allah's Apostle content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah's Apostle once said, ""Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say."" So, I spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Allah's Apostle had finished his saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations."

Sa`d bin Ar-Rabi` said (to me), 'I am the richest among the Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, and when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you may marry her.' `Abdur-Rahman replied, ""I am not in need of all that. Is there any marketplace where trade is practiced?' He replied, ""The market of Qainuqa."" `Abdur- Rahman went to that market the following day and brought some dried buttermilk (yogurt) and butter, and then he continued going there regularly. Few days later, `Abdur-Rahman came having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah's Apostle asked him whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.' Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone of gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if with one sheep .' """

Sa`d was a rich man, so he said to `Abdur-Rahman, ""I will give you half of my property and will help you marry."" `Abdur-Rahman said (to him), ""May Allah bless you in your family and property. Show me the market."" So `Abdur-Rahman did not return from the market) till he gained some dried buttermilk (yogurt) and butter (through trading). He brought that to his house-hold.

Sarah,30," Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir:                     The Prophet said ""Both legal and illegal things are obvious, and in between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So whoever forsakes those doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid what is clearly illegal; and whoever indulges in these (suspicious) doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit what is clearly illegal.

I replied in the affirmative. He said, ""Leave your camel and come into (the mosque) and pray two rak`at."" I entered and offered the prayer. He told Bilal to weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold.

The sub-narrator, Hammam said, ""I found this in my book: 'Both the buyer and the seller give the option of either confirming or canceling the bargain three times, and if they speak the truth and mention the defects, then their bargain will be blessed, and if they tell lies and conceal the defects, they might gain some financial gain but they will deprive their sale of (Allah's) blessings."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn 'Umar (ra) :                      We were accompanying the Prophet () on a journey and I was riding an unmanageable camel belonging to 'Umar (ra), and I could not bring it under my control. So, it used to go ahead of the party and 'Umar would check it and force it to retreat, and again it went ahead and again 'Umar forced it to retreat. The Prophet () asked 'Umar to sell that camel to him. 'Umar replied, ""It is for you O Allah's Messenger !"" Allah's Messenger () told 'Umar to sell that camel to him (not to give it as gift).

When we finished the deal, I left immediately and got out of his house lest he should cancel the deal, for the tradition was that they buyer and the seller had the option of canceling the bargain unless they separated.  When out deal was completed, I came to know that I have been unfair to 'Uthman, for by selling him my land I caused him to be in a land of Thamud, at a distance of three days journey from Al-Madina, while he made me neared to Al-Madina, at a distance of three days journey from my former land."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     A person came to the Prophet and told him that he was always betrayed in purchasing. The Prophet told him to say at the time of buying, ""No cheating."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""The congregational prayer of anyone amongst you is more than twenty (five or twenty seven) times in reward than his prayer in the market or in his house, for if he performs ablution completely and then goes to the mosque with the sole intention of performing the prayer, and nothing urges him to proceed to the mosque except the prayer, then, on every step which he takes towards the mosque, he will be raised one degree or one of his sins will be forgiven. The angels will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness and blessings for everyone of you so long as he keeps sitting at his praying place. The angels will say, 'O Allah, bless him! O Allah, be merciful to him!' as long as he does not do Hadath or a thing which gives trouble to the other.""

Love him, and love whoever loves him.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ata bin Yasar:                     I met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and asked him, ""Tell me about the description of Allah's Apostle which is mentioned in Torah (i.e. Old Testament."") He replied, 'Yes. By Allah, he is described in Torah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur'an as follows: ""O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Allah's True religion) And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you ""Al-Mutawakkil"" (who depends upon Allah). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a noisemaker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness.

The Ajwa on one side, the cluster of Ibn Zaid on another side, etc.. Then call me."" I did that and called the Prophet He came and sat at the head or in the middle of the heaps and ordered me. Measure (the dates) for the people (creditors)."" I measured for them till I paid all the debts. My dates remained as it nothing had been taken from them. In other narrations, Jabir said; The Prophet said, ""He (i.e. `Abdullah) continued measuring for them till he paid all the debts.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Rarely did the Prophet fail to visit Abu Bakr's house everyday, either in the morning or in the evening.

The Prophet said, ""You will accompany me."" Abu Bakr then said ""O Allah's Apostle! I have two she-camels I have prepared specially for migration, so I offer you one of them.

And one should not urge somebody to return the goods to the seller so as to sell him his own goods; nor should one demand the hand of a girl who has already been engaged to someone else; and a woman should not try to cause some other woman to be divorced in order to take her place.
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     A man decided that a slave of his would be manumitted after his death and later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet took the slave and said, ""Who will buy this slave from me?"" Nu'aim bin `Abdullah bought him for such and such price and the Prophet gave him the slave."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle forbade Najsh.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle forbade the sale called 'Habal-al-Habala which was a kind of sale practiced in the Pre- Islamic Period of ignorance.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     Allah's Apostle forbade the selling by Munabadha, i.e. to sell one's garment by casting it to the buyer not allowing him to examine or see it. Similarly he forbade the selling by Mulamasa. Mulamasa is to buy a garment, for example, by merely touching it, not looking at it."
Sarah,30, Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet forbade two kinds of dressing; (one of them) is to sit with one's legs drawn up while wrapped in one garment. (The other) is to lift that garment on one's shoulders. And also forbade two kinds of sale: Al-Limais and An-Nibadh.

Some narrated from Ibn Seereen (that the Prophet had said), ""One Sa of wheat, and he has the option for three days."" And some narrated from Ibn Seereen, "" ... a Sa of dates,"" not mentioning the option for three days. But a Sa of dates is mentioned in most narrations."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     Whoever buys a sheep which has not been milked for a long time, has the option of returning it along with one Sa of dates; and the Prophet forbade going to meet the seller on the way (as he has no knowledge of the market price and he may sell his goods at a low price)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Do not go forward to meet the caravan (to buy from it on the way before it reaches the town). And do not urge buyers to cancel their purchases to sell them (your own goods) yourselves, and do not practice Najsh. A town dweller should not sell the goods for the desert dweller. Do not leave sheep unmilked for a long time, when they are on sale, and whoever buys such an animal has the option of returning it, after milking it, along with a Sa of dates or keeping it. it has been kept unmilked for a long period by the seller (to deceive others)."

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:                     Allah's Apostle was asked about the slave-girl, if she was a virgin and committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said, ""If she committed illegal sexual intercourse, lash her, and if she did it a second time, then lash her again, and if she repeated the third time, then sell her even for a hair rope."" Ibn Shihab said, ""I don't know whether to sell her after the third or fourth offense."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle came to me and I told him about the slave-girl (Buraira) Allah's Apostle said, ""Buy and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits."" In the evening the Prophet got up and glorified Allah as He deserved and then said, ""Why do some people impose conditions which are not present in Allah's Book (Laws)? Whoever imposes such a condition as is not in Allah's Laws, then that condition is invalid even if he imposes one hundred conditions, for Allah's conditions are more binding and reliable."""

"" Hammam asked Nafi` whether her (Buraira's) husband was a free man or a slave. He replied that he did not know."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jarir:                     I have given a pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle for to testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay Zakat, to listen to and obey (Allah's and His Prophet's orders), and to give good advice to every Muslim."

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     Whoever buys an animal which has been kept unmilked for a long time, could return it, but has to pay a Sa of dates along with it. And the Prophet forbade meeting the owners of goods on the way away from the market."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""You should not try to cancel the purchases of one another (to get a benefit thereof), and do not go ahead to meet the caravan (for buying the goods) (but wait) till it reaches the market."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     We used to go ahead to meet the caravan and used to buy foodstuff from them. The Prophet forbade us to sell it till it was carried to the market.
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     Some people used to buy foodstuff at the head of the market and used to sell it on the spot. Allah's Apostle forbade them to sell it till they brought it to (their) places.

I said, 'I am ready to pay the whole amount now provided your masters agree that your Wala will be for me.' So, Buraira went to her masters and told them about that offer but they refused to accept it. She returned, and at that time, Allah's Apostle was sitting (present). Buraira said, 'I told them of the offer but they did not accept it and insisted on having the Wala.'.' The Prophet heard that."" `Aisha narrated the whole story to the Prophet . He said to her, ""Buy her and stipulate that her Wala' would be yours as the Wala' is for the manumitted."" `Aisha did so. Then Allah's Apostle stood up in front of the people, and after glorifying Allah he said, ""Amma Badu (i.e. then after)! What about the people who impose conditions which are not in Allah's Book (Laws)?

Sufyan (in another narration) said, ""I told Yahya (a sub-narrator) when I was a mere boy, 'Meccans say that the Prophet allowed them the sale of the fruits on 'Araya by estimation.' Yahya asked, 'How do the Meccans know about it?' I replied, 'They narrated it (from the Prophet ) through Jabir.' On that, Yahya kept quiet."" Sufyan said, ""I meant that Jabir belonged to Medina.""

Sarah,30," Zaid bin Thabit (ra) said, ""In the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (), the people used to trade with fruits. When they cut their date-fruits and the purchasers came to recieve their rights, the seller would say, 'My dates have got rotten, they are blighted with disease, they are afflicted with Qusham (a disease which causes the fruit to fall before ripening).' They would go on complaining of defects in their purchases. Allah's Messenger () said, ""Do not sell the fruits before their benefit is evident (i.e. free from all the dangers of being spoiled or blighted), by way of advice for they quarrelled too much."" Kharija bin Zaid bin Thabit said that Zaid bin Thabit (ra) used not to sell the fruits of his land till Pleiades appeared and one could distinguish the yellow fruits from the red (ripe) ones."

Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi', the freed slave of Ibn 'Umar:                      If pollinated date-palms are sold and nothing is mentioned (in the contract) about their fruits, the fruits will go to the person who has pollinated them, and so will be the case with the slave and the cultivator. Nafi' mentioned those three things."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If somebody sells pollinated date palms, the fruits will be for the seller unless the buyer stipulates that they will be for himself (and the seller agrees)."

Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     Allah's Apostle decided the validity of preemption in every joint undivided property, but if the boundaries were well marked or the ways and streets were fixed, then there was no pre-emption."

My parents were old and I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk (the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. After they had drunk from it, I would give it to my children, family and wife. One day I was delayed and on my return I found my parents sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were crying at my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it was dawn. O Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then please remove this rock so that we may see the sky.' So, the rock was moved a bit. The second said, 'O Allah! You know that I was in love with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a woman, and she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, kindly remove this rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed. Then the third man said, 'O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one Faraq (three Sa's) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a shepherd. After a time that man came and demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I was not joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You regard that I did it sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.' So, the rock was removed completely from the mouth of the cave."""

Then Abraham returned to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.' Then Abraham sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' On that the king fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' The king again fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, 'By Allah! You have sent a satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.'

He then said, 'Who will work for me from the `Asr till sunset for two Qirats?' You, Muslims have accepted the offer.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of Muslims, Jews and Christians is like the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and then said, 'We do not need your money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be annulled.' The man said to them, 'Don't quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.' But they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first batch.' So, they worked till the time of `Asr prayer. Then they said, ""Let what we have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.' The man said to them, 'Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,' but they refused. Thereafter he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the example of this light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""Three men from among those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda to the righteous deed which you have done (for Allah's sake only).' So, one of them said, 'O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from our critical situation caused by this rock.' So, the rock shifted a little but they could not get out."" The Prophet added, ""The second man said, 'O Allah! I had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from the present calamity.' So, the rock shifted a little more but still they could not get out from there."" The Prophet added, ""Then the third man said, 'O Allah! I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby. (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah's slave! Pay me my wages. I said to him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah's slave! Don't mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from the present suffering.' So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu May' id Al-Ansari:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle ordered us to give in charity we would go to the market and work as porters to earn a Mudd (two handfuls) (of foodstuff) but now some of us have one-hundred thousand Dirhams or Diners.

He said, ""Will I be dead and then resurrected after my death?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""There I will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due."" Then Allah revealed.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey till they reached some of the 'Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said (to the others), ""Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment),"" They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, ""Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has not benefited. Have you got anything (useful)?"" One of them replied, ""Yes, by Allah! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it."" They agrees to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Surat-ul-Fatiha): 'All the praises are for the Lord of the Worlds' and puffed over the chief who became all right as if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of sickness. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the recitation said, ""Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order."" So, they went to Allah's Apostle and narrated the story. Allah's Apostle asked, ""How did you come to know that Suratul- Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?"" Then he added, ""You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well."" The Prophet smiled thereupon."

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          The Prophet said, ""An Israeli man asked another Israeli to lend him      one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former      replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a witness.' The second said, 'I want      a surety.' The former replied, 'Allah is sufficient as a surety.' The      second said, 'You are right,' and lent him the money for a certain      period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his job, he      searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the      repayment of the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece      of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it one thousand Dinars and      a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly.     He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. 'O Allah! You know well     that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded      a surety from me but I told him that Allah's Guarantee was sufficient      and he accepted Your guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told     him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a      Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could      pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.'      Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out      far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started searching for     a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country.      One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had      arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of      wood in which his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for     fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.      Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one thousand Dinars to      him and said, 'By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that      I could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I      have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The      debtor replied, 'I have told you I could not get a boat other than the     one I have come by.' The lender said, 'Allah has delivered on your      behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your      one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.' """

(And regarding the verse) 'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.' Ibn `Abbas said, ""When the emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the latter's relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: 'And to everyone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, it canceled (the bond (the pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance)."" Then he said, ""The verse: To those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding cooperation and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign something in one's testament to the person who had the right of inheriting before."

Sarah,30," Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa`:                     A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, ""Is he in debt?"" When the people replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he asked, ""Is he in debt?"" They said, ""Yes."" He (refused to lead the prayer and) said, ""Lead the prayer of your friend."" Abu Qatada said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt."" Allah's Apostle then led his funeral prayer."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     Once the Prophet said (to me), ""If the money of Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it."" The Prophet had breathed his last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr announced, ""Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us."" I went to Abu Bakr and said, ""The Prophet promised me so and so."" Abu Bakr gave me a handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then said, ""Take twice the amount you have taken (besides)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     (wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Allah's Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, ""Where are you going?"" Abu Bakr said, ""My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord."" Ibn Ad- Daghna said, ""A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home."" Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, ""A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?"" So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, ""Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him."" Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur'an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Qur'an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur'an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, ""We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur'an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's public declaration of Islam (his worshipping). `Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, ""You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect it."" Abu Bakr said, ""I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with Allah's protection."" At that time Allah's Apostle was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, ""Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras."" So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Allah's Apostle said to him, ""Wait, for I expect to be permitted to emigrate."" Abu Bakr asked, ""May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?"" Allah's Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah's Apostle and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah's Apostle he would ask, ""Has he left anything to repay his debt?"" If he was informed that he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet wealthy through conquests, he said, ""I am more rightful than other believers to be the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his heirs.

Sarah,30, Narrated `Ali:                     Allah's Apostle ordered me to distribute the saddles and skins of the Budn which I had slaughtered.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf:                     I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf that Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would look after his in Medina. When I mentioned the word 'Ar64 Rahman' in the documents, Umaiya said, ""I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me your name, (with which you called yourself) in the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance."" So, I wrote my name ' `Abdu `Amr'. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill to protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, ""(Here is) Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!"" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us (`Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I left Umaiya's son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his sword. (The sub narrator said, "" `Abdur-Rahman used to show us the trace of the wound on the back of his foot."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar. When the man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The Prophet asked him, ""Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?"" The man replied, ""(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two."" On that, the Prophet said, ""Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib with the money"". The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by weight. (See Hadith No. 506)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Ka`b bin Malik from his father:                     We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala'. One of our slavegirls saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with it. My father said to the people, ""Don't eat it till I ask the Prophet about it (or till I send somebody to ask the Prophet)."" So, he asked or sent somebody to ask the Prophet, and the Prophet permitted him to eat it. 'Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, ""I admire that girl, for though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet owed somebody a camel of a certain age. When he came to demand it back, the Prophet said (to some people), ""Give him (his due)."" When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found none, but found a camel one year older. The Prophet said, ""Give (it to) him."" On that, the man remarked, ""You have given me my right in full. May Allah give you in full."" The Prophet said, ""The best amongst you is the one who pays the rights of others generously."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man came to the Prophet demanding his debts and behaved rudely. The companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but Allah's Apostle said (to them), ""Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) has the right to speak."" Allah's Apostle then said, ""Give him a camel of the same age as that of his."" The people said, ""O Allah's Apostle! There is only a camel that is older than his."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Give (it to) him, for the best amongst you is he who pays the rights of others handsomely."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:                     When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came to Allah's Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their properties and their captives. Allah's Apostle said to them, ""The most beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed distributing them."" The narrator added, Allah's Apostle c had been waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that Allah's Apostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, ""We choose our captives."" So, Allah's Apostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, and said, ""Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so."" The people replied, ""We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor for Allah's Apostle."" Then Allah's Apostle said, ""We don't know who amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may tell us your opinion."" So, all of them returned and their chiefs discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came to Allah's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given up their shares gladly and willingly."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding a slow camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and asked, ""Who is this?"" I replied, ""Jabir bin `Abdullah."" He asked, ""What is the matter, (why are you late)?"" I replied, ""I am riding a slow camel."" He asked, ""Do you have a stick?"" I replied in the affirmative. He said, ""Give it to me."" When I gave it to him, he beat the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others thenceforth. The Prophet said, ""Sell it to me."" I replied, ""It is (a gift) for you, O Allah's Apostle."" He said, ""Sell it to me. I have bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it till Medina."" When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my house). The Prophet said, ""Where are you going?"" I Sa`d, ""I have married a widow."" He said, ""Why have you not married a virgin to fondle with each other?"" I said, ""My father died and left daughters, so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after them)."" He said, ""Well done."" When we reached Medina, Allah's Apostle said, ""O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra money."" Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator said): Jabir added, ""The extra Qirat of Allah's Apostle never parted from me."" The Qirat was always in Jabir bin `Abdullah's purse."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Sahl bin Sad:                          A woman came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I want      to give up myself to you."" A man said, ""Marry her to me."" The Prophet      said, ""We agree to marry her to you with what you know of the Qur'an      by heart."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          Allah's Apostle deputed me to keep Sadaqat (al-Fitr) of Ramadan. A      comer came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff (of the      Sadaqa) (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, ""By Allah, I will      take you to Allah's Apostle ."" He said, ""I am needy and have many      dependents, and I am in great need."" I released him, and in the      morning Allah's Apostle asked me, ""What did your prisoner do      yesterday?"" I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! The person complained of being     needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go.""     Allah's Apostle said, ""Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming     again."" I believed that he would show up again as Allah's Apostle had      told me that he would return. So, I waited for him watchfully. When he     (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold      of him again and said, ""I will definitely take you to Allah's Apostle.     He said, ""Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I      promise I will not come back again."" I pitied him and let him go.      In the morning Allah's Apostle asked me, ""What did your prisoner do.""      I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! He complained of his great need and of      too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free."" Allah's      Apostle said, ""Verily, he told you a lie and he will return."" I waited     for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started     stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, ""I      will surely take you to Allah's Apostle as it is the third time you      promise not to return, yet you break your promise and come."" He said,      ""(Forgive me and) I will teach you some words with which Allah will      benefit you."" I asked, ""What are they?"" He replied, ""Whenever you go      to bed, recite ""Ayat-al-Kursi""-- 'Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-l-Haiy-ul      Qaiyum' till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will      appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no satan will come      near you till morning. "" So, I released him. In the morning, Allah's      Apostle asked, ""What did your prisoner do yesterday?"" I replied, ""He      claimed that he would teach me some words by which Allah will benefit      me, so I let him go."" Allah's Apostle asked, ""What are they?"" I      replied, ""He said to me, 'Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi     from the beginning to the end ---- Allahu la ilaha illa      huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum----.' He further said to me, '(If you do so),      Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you, and no      satan will come near you till morning.' (Abu Huraira or another      sub-narrator) added that they (the companions) were very keen to do      good deeds. The Prophet said, ""He really spoke the truth, although he      is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three     nights, O Abu Huraira?"" Abu Huraira said, ""No."" He said, ""It was      Satan."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id al-Khudri:                     Once Bilal brought Barni (i.e. a kind of dates) to the Prophet and the Prophet asked him, ""From where have you brought these?"" Bilal replied, ""I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of it for one Sa of Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat."" Thereupon the Prophet said, ""Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba (usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)! Don't do so, but if you want to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for money and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr:                     Concerning the Waqf of `Umar: It was not sinful of the trustee (of the Waqf) to eat or provide his friends from it, provided the trustee had no intention of collecting fortune (for himself). Ibn `Umar was the manager of the trust of `Umar and he used to give presents from it to those with whom he used to stay at Mecca."
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Khalid and Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""O Unais! Go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse), then stone her to death."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith:                     When An-Nuaman or his son was brought in a state of drunkenness, Allah's Apostle ordered all those who were present in the house to beat him. I was one of those who beat him. We beat him with shoes and palm-leaf stalks."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I twisted the garlands of the Hadis (i.e. animals for sacrifice) of Allah's Apostle with my own hands. Then Allah's Apostle put them around their necks with his own hands, and sent them with my father (to Mecca). Nothing legal was regarded illegal for Allah's Apostle till the animals were slaughtered."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar and Beeruha' (garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated opposite the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah's Apostle used to enter it and drink from its sweet water. When the following Divine Verse were revealed: 'you will not attain righteousness till you spend in charity of the things you love' (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Allah says in His Book, 'You will not attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you love,' and verily, the most beloved to me of my property is Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope for its reward from Allah. O Allah's Apostle! Spend it wherever you like."" Allah's Apostle appreciated that and said, ""That is perishable wealth, that is perishable wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to distribute it among your relatives."" Abu Talha said, ""I will do so, O Allah's Apostle."" So, Abu Talha distributed it among his relatives and cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The Prophet said: ""That is a profitable wealth,"" instead of ""perishable wealth""."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet said, ""An honest treasurer who gives what he is ordered to give fully, perfectly and willingly to the person to whom he is ordered to give, is regarded as one of the two charitable persons."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There is none amongst the Muslims who plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it, but is regarded as a charitable gift for him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Umama al-Bahili:                     I saw some agricultural equipment and said: ""I heard the Prophet saying: ""There is no house in which these equipment enters except that Allah will cause humiliation to enter it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Whoever keeps a dog, one Qirat of the reward of his good deeds is deducted daily, unless the dog is used for guarding a farm or cattle."" Abu Huraira (in another narration) said from the Prophet, ""unless it is used for guarding sheep or farms, or for hunting."" Narrated Abu Hazim from Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, ""A dog for guarding cattle or for hunting."""
Sarah,30," Narrated As-Sa'ib bin Yazid:                     Abu Sufyan bin Abu Zuhair, a man from Azd Shanu'a and one of the companions of the Prophet said, ""I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'If one keeps a dog which is meant for guarding neither a farm nor cattle, one Qirat of the reward of his good deeds is deducted daily."" I said, ""Did you hear this from Allah's Apostle?"" He said, ""Yes, by the Lord of this Mosque."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""While a man was riding a cow, it turned towards him and said, 'I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I have been created for sloughing."" The Prophet added, ""I, Abu Bakr and `Umar believe in the story."" The Prophet went on, ""A wolf caught a sheep, and when the shepherd chased it, the wolf said, 'Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when there will be no shepherd for it except me?' ""After narrating it, the Prophet said, ""I, Abu Bakr and `Umar too believe it."" Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said, ""Abu Bakr and `Umar were not present then."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Ansar said to the Prophet ""Distribute the date palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers."" He replied, ""No."" The Ansar said (to the emigrants), ""Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share the fruits with us."" The emigrants said, ""We listen and obey."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin Thabit said in a poetic verse: ""The chiefs of Bani Lu'ai found it easy to watch fire spreading at Al-Buwaira."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij:                     We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get so-and-so much."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When `Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and `Aisha chose the land."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr:                     I said to Tawus, ""I wish you would give up Mukhabara (Sharecropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it."" On that Tawus replied, ""O `Amr! I give the land to sharecroppers and help them. No doubt; the most learned man, namely Ibn `Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, 'It is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one's brother than to charge him a fixed rental."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew's on the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield."
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi`:                     We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the land and say to the owner, ""The yield of this portion is for us and the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent)."" One of those portions might yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""While three men were walking, It started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, ""Think of good deeds which you did for Allah's sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you."" One of them said, 'O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.' So, Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, 'O Allah! I was in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, 'O Allah's slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).' So, I got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.' The rock shifted a little more. Then the third man said, 'O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, 'Fear Allah (and give me my right)."" I said, 'Go and take those cows and the shepherd.' He said, 'Be afraid of Allah! Don't mock at me.' I said, 'I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).' So, he took all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.' So, Allah removed the rock."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:                     `Umar said, ""But for the future Muslim generations, I would have distributed the land of the villages I conquer among the soldiers as the Prophet distributed the land of Khaibar."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet said, ""He who cultivates land that does not belong to anybody is more rightful (to own it)."" `Urwa said, ""`Umar gave the same verdict in his Caliphate."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said to him, ""You are in a blessed valley."" Musa said, ""Salim let our camels kneel at the place where `Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where Allah's Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     While the Prophet was in Al-`Aqiq he said, ""Someone (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, 'Offer the prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) `Umra along with Hajj (together).' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     `Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When Allah's Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah's Apostle intended to expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah's Apostle told them, ""We will let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish."" So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on living there until `Umar forced them to go towards Taima' and Ariha'."
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij:                     My uncle Zuhair said, ""Allah's Apostle forbade us to do a thing which was a source of help to us."" I said, ""Whatever Allah's Apostle said was right."" He said, ""Allah's Apostle sent for me and asked, 'What are you doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs of barley and dates.' Allah's Apostle said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.' I said, 'We hear and obey.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     The people used to rent their land for cultivation for one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, ""Whoever has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it uncultivated."" Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, ""Whoever has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise he should keep it uncultivated."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr:                     When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi` 'bin Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, ""It is permissible to rent the land for cultivation, for Ibn `Abbas said, 'The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had better give the land to one's brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.' """
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi` 'bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn `Umar went to Rafi` and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi` who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn `Umar said, ""You know that we used to rent our farms in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and for certain amount of figs."
Sarah,30," Narrated Salim:                     `Abdullah bin `Umar said, ""I knew that the land was rented for cultivation in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle ."" Later on Ibn `Umar was afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up renting his land."
Sarah,30," Narrated Hanzla bin Qais:                     Rafi` bin Khadij said, ""My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the lifetime of the Prophet for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it."" I said to Rafi`, ""What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?"" He replied, ""There is no harm in renting for Dinars- Dirhams. Al-Laith said, ""If those who have discernment for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin was sitting with him. ""One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, 'Are you not living in the pleasures you like?' He will say, 'Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.' "" The Prophet added, ""When the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink. Allah will then say to him, 'O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing satisfies you.' "" On that, the bedouin said, ""The man must be either from Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not farmers."" The Prophet smiled (at this)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water streams, and cook them in a pot of her's, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya'qub, the sub-narrator said, ""I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain fat or melted fat (taken from meat)."") When we offered the Friday prayer we would go to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e. Friday prayer)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, ""Why do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?"" In fact, my emigrant brethren were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I was a poor man keeping the company of Allah's Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said, ""Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement."" So, I spread my covering sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah's Apostle) with the truth, since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah's Book, I would never have related any narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): ""Verily! Those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down .....(up to) the Merciful.' (2.159-160)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, ""O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old men?"" The boy said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk."" So, the Prophet gave it to him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zuhri:                     Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked for Allah's Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed with water drawn from the well in Anas's house. A tumbler of it was presented to Allah's Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his right side. When the Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, `Umar was afraid that the Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. ""O Allah's Apostle! Give it to Abu Bakr who is sitting by your side."" But the Prophet gave it to the bedouin, who was to his right and said, ""You should start with the one on your right side."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Do not withhold the superfluous water, for that will prevent people from grazing their cattle."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""No bloodmoney will be charged if somebody dies in a mine or in a well or is killed by an animal; and if somebody finds a treasure in his land he has to give one-fifth of it to the Government."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud):                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever takes a false oath to deprive somebody of his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him."" Allah revealed: 'Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant, and their oaths.' ........(3.77) Al-Ashath came (to the place where `Abdullah was narrating) and said, ""What has Abu `Abdur- Rahman (i.e. `Abdullah) been telling you? This verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin of mine. The Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my claim). I said, 'I don't have witnesses.' He said, 'Let the defendant take an oath then.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will take a (false) oath immediately.' Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said."" (See Hadith No. 692)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There are three persons whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs shall be a severe punishment. They are: -1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from travelers. -2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. -3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the `Asr prayer and he said, 'By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys them). The Prophet then recited: ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths."" (3.77)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:                     An Ansari man quarreled with Az-Zubair in the presence of the Prophet about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, ""Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said to Az-Zubair, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor."" On that the Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, ""Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?"" On that the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and he said, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees."" Zubair said, ""By Allah, I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion"": ""But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them."" (4.65)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     When a man from the Ansar quarreled with Az-Zubair, the Prophet said, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then let the water flow (to the land of the others)."" ""On that the Ansari said, (to the Prophet), ""It is because he is your aunt's son."" On that the Prophet said, ""O Zubair! Irrigate till the water reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let the water go to the other's land)."" I think the following verse was revealed concerning this event: ""But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them."" (4.65)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:                     An Ansari man quarreled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah's Apostle, ordering Zubair to be moderate, said, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for your neighbor."" The Ansari said, ""Is it because he is your aunt's son?"" On that the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed and he said, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the pits around the trees."" So, Allah's Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said, ""By Allah, the following verse was revealed in that connection"": ""But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them."" (4.65) (The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator), ""The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet, 'Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits around the trees,' as meaning up to the ankles."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine. So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him."" The people asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?"" He replied, ""Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:                     The Prophet prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, ""Hell was displayed so close that I said, 'O my Lord ! Am I going to be one of its inhabitants?""' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who was being scratched by a cat. He said, ""What is wrong with her?"" He was told, ""She had imprisoned it (i.e. the cat) till it died of hunger."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""A woman was tortured and was put in Hell because of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger."" Allah's Apostle further said, (Allah knows better) Allah said (to the woman), 'You neither fed it nor watered when you locked it up, nor did you set it free to eat the insects of the earth."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     Once a tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to Allah's Apostle who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, ""O boy ! Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people (first)?"" The boy said, ""I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O Allah's Apostle!"" So, he gave it to the boy."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will drive some people out from my (sacred) Fount on the Day of Resurrection as strange camels are expelled from a private trough."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, ""May Allah be merciful to the mother of Ishmael! If she had left the water of Zamzam (fountain) as it was, (without constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, ""If she had not taken handfuls of its water""), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and asked her, 'May we settle at your dwelling?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to possess the water.' They agreed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""There are three types of people whom Allah will neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are): -1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered for his goods so much more than what he is given, -2. a man who takes a false oath after the `Asr prayer in order to grab a Muslim's property, and -3. a man who withholds his superfluous water. Allah will say to him, ""Today I will withhold My Grace from you as you withheld the superfluity of what you had not created."""
Sarah,30," Narrated As-Sab bin Jath-thama:                     Allah's Apostle said, No Hima except for Allah and His Apostle. We have been told that Allah's Apostle made a place called An-Naqi' as Hima, and `Umar made Ash-Sharaf and Ar-Rabadha Hima (for grazing the animals of Zakat)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Keeping horses may be a source of reward to some (man), a shelter to another (i.e. means of earning one's living), or a burden to a third. He to whom the horse will be a source of reward is the one who keeps it in Allah's Cause (prepare it for holy battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or a garden). He will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses one or two hills, then all its footsteps and its dung will be counted as good deeds for its owner; and if it passes by a river and drinks from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed for its owner even if he has had no intention of watering it then. Horses are a shelter from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning his living so as not to ask others, and at the same time he gives Allah's right (i.e. rak`at) (from the wealth he earns through using them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps horses just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming the Muslims, his horses will be a source of sins to him."" When Allah's Apostle was asked about donkeys, he replied, ""Nothing particular was revealed to me regarding them except the general unique verse which is applicable to everything: ""Whoever does goodness equal to the weight of an atom (or small ant) shall see it (its reward) on the Day of Resurrection."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:                     A man came to Allah's Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a fallen thing). The Prophet said, ""Recognize its container and its tying material and then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like."" The man said, ""What about a lost sheep?"" The Prophet said, ""It is for you, your brother or the wolf."" The man said ""What about a lost camel?"" The Prophet said, ""Why should you take it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zubair bin Al 'Awwam:                     The Prophet said, ""No doubt, one had better take a rope (and cut) and tie a bundle of wood and sell it whereby Allah will keep his face away (from Hell-fire) rather than ask others who may give him or not."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""No doubt, you had better gather a bundle of wood and carry it on your back (and earn your living thereby) rather than ask somebody who may give you or not."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Husain bin `Ali:                     `Ali bin Abi Talib said: ""I got a she-camel as my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and Allah's Apostle gave me another she-camel. I let both of them kneel at the door of one of the Ansar, intending to carry Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet on marrying Fatima. A goldsmith from Bani Qainqa' was with me. Hamza bin `Abdul-Muttalib was in that house drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: ""O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she camels (and serve them to your guests). So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels and cut off their humps and opened their flanks and took a part of their livers."" (I said to Ibn Shihab, ""Did he take part of the humps?"" He replied, ""He cut off their humps and carried them away."") `Ali further said, ""When I saw that dreadful sight, I went to the Prophet and told him the news. The Prophet came out in the company of Zaid bin Haritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza looked up and said, 'Aren't you only the slaves of my forefathers?' The Prophet retreated and went out. This incident happened before the prohibition of drinking."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet decided to grant a portion of (the uncultivated land of) Bahrain to the Ansar. The Ansar said, ""(We will not accept it) till you give a similar portion to our emigrant brothers (from Quraish)."" He said, ""(O Ansar!) You will soon see people giving preference to others, so remain patient till you meet me (on the Day of Resurrection)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas (ra):                      The Prophet () called the Ansar so as to grant them a portion of (the land of) Bahrain. They said, ""O Allah's Messenger ! If you grant this to is, write a similar document on our Quraish (emigrant) brothers."" But the Prophet () did not have enough grants and he said: ""After me you will see the people giving preference (to others), so be patient till you meet me."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""One of the rights of a she camel is that it should be milked at a place of water."""
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Abdullah (ra) said, I heard the Messenger of Allah () say ""If somebody buys date-palms after they have been pollinated, the fruits will belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulates the contrary. If somebody buys a slave having some property, the property will belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulate that it should belong to him."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:                     The Prophet permitted selling the dates of the 'Araya for ready dates by estimating the amount of the former (as they are still on the trees).
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet forbade the sales called Al-Mukhabara, Al-Muhaqala and Al-Muzabana and the selling of fruits till they are free from blights. He forbade the selling of the fruits except for money, except the 'Araya."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet allowed the sale of the dates of the 'Araya for ready dates by estimating the former which should be estimated as less than five Awsuq or five Awsuq. (Dawud, the sub-narrator is not sure as to the right amount.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi` 'bin Khadij and Sahl bin Abi Hathma:                     Allah's Apostle forbade the sale of Muzabana, i.e. selling of fruits for fruits, except in the case of 'Araya; he allowed the owners of 'Araya such kind of sale."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     While I was in the company of the Prophet in one of his Ghazawat, he asked, ""What is wrong with your camel? Will you sell it?"" I replied in the affirmative and sold it to him. When he reached Medina, I took the camel to him in the morning and he paid me its price."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-A`mash:                     When we were with Ibrahim, we talked about mortgaging in deals of Salam. Ibrahim narrated from Aswad that `Aisha had said, ""The Prophet bought some foodstuff on credit from a Jew and mortgaged an iron armor to him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever takes the money of the people with the intention of repaying it, Allah will repay it on his behalf, and whoever takes it in order to spoil it, then Allah will spoil him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Dhar:                     Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain of Uhud and said, ""I would not like to have this mountain turned into gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Allah's Cause), except that Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts."" Then he said, ""Those who are rich in this world would have little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in Allah's Cause), and they are few in number."" Then he ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard a voice and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, ""Stay at your place till I return."" On his return I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! (What was) that noise which I heard?"" He said, ""Did you hear anything?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Gabriel came and said to me, 'Whoever amongst your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter Paradise.' "" I said, ""Even if he did such-and-such things (i.e. even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse)"" He said, ""Yes."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If I had gold equal to the mountain of Uhud, it would not please me that it should remain with me for more than three days, except an amount which I would keep for repaying debts."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man demanded his debts from Allah's Apostle in such a rude manner that the companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but the Prophet said, ""Leave him, no doubt, for he (the creditor) has the right to demand it (harshly). Buy a camel and give it to him."" They said, ""The camel that is available is older than the camel he demands. ""The Prophet said, ""Buy it and give it to him, for the best among you are those who repay their debts handsomely. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Hudhaifa:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""Once a man died and was asked, 'What did you use to say (or do) (in your life time)?' He replied, 'I was a businessman and used to give time to the rich to repay his debt and (used to) deduct part of the debt of the poor.' So he was forgiven (his sins.)"" Abu Mas`ud said, ""I heard the same (Hadith) from the Prophet."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man came to the Prophet and demanded a camel (the Prophet owed him). Allah's Apostle told his companions to give him (a camel). They said, ""We do not find except an older camel (than what he demands). (The Prophet ordered them to give him that camel). The man said, ""You have paid me in full and may Allah also pay you in full.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet owed a camel of a certain age to a man who came to demand it back. The Prophet ordered his companions to give him.

The man said, ""You have paid me in full, and may Allah pay you in full."" The Prophet said, ""The best amongst you is he who pays his debts in the most handsome manner."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     I went to the Prophet while he was in the Mosque. (Mas`ar thinks, that Jabir went in the forenoon.) After the Prophet told me to pray two rak`at, he repaid me the debt he owed me and gave me an extra amount."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud, and he was in debt. His creditors demanded their rights persistently. I went to the Prophet (and informed him about it). He told them to take the fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early in the morning and wandered among the date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for us."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     When my father died he owed a Jew thirty Awsuq (of dates). I requested him to give me respite for repaying but he refused. I requested Allah's Apostle to intercede with the Jew. Allah's Apostle went to the Jew and asked him to accept the fruits of my trees in place of the debt but the Jew refused. Allah's Apostle entered the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying), ""Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due."" So, I plucked the fruits for him after the departure of Allah's Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Allah's Apostle to inform of what had happened, but found him praying the `Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the extra fruits which remained. Allah's Apostle told me to inform (`Umar) Ibn Al-Khattab about it. When I went to `Umar and told him about it, `Umar said, ""When Allah's Apostle walked in your garden, I was sure that Allah would definitely bless it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle used to invoke Allah in the prayer saying, ""O Allah, I seek refuge with you from all sins, and from being in debt."" Someone said, O Allah's Apostle! (I see you) very often you seek refuge with Allah from being in debt. He replied, ""If a person is in debt, he tells lies when he speaks, and breaks his promises when he promises."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""If someone leaves some property, it will be for the inheritors, and if he leaves some weak offspring, it will be for us to support them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""I am closer to the believers than their selves in this world and in the Hereafter, and if you like, you can read Allah's Statement: ""The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves."" (33.6) So, if a true believer dies and leaves behind some property, it will be for his inheritors (from the father's side), and if he leaves behind some debt to be paid or needy offspring, then they should come to me as I am the guardian of the deceased."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Procrastination (delay) in repaying debts by a wealthy person is injustice."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Hurairah (ra):                      Allah's Messenger () mentioned an Israeli man who asked another Israeli to lend him money, and the latter gave it to him for a fixed period. (Abu Hurairah mentioned the rest of narration) [See  chapter: Kafala in loans and debts. Hadith 2291]"
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     When `Abdullah (my father) died, he left behind children and debts. I asked the lenders to put down some of his debt, but they refused, so I went to the Prophet to intercede with them, yet they refused. The Prophet said (to me), ""Classify your dates into their different kinds: 'Adha bin Zaid, Lean and 'Ajwa, each kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you."" I did so and the Prophet came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid them fully, and the amount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched them. (On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among with the Prophet and I was riding one of our camels. The camel got tired and was lagging behind the others. The Prophet hit it on its back. He said, ""Sell it to me, and you have the right to ride it till Medina.'' When we approached Medina, I took the permission from the Prophet to go to my house, saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have newly married."" The Prophet asked, ""Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or divorcee)?"" I said, ""I have married a matron, as `Abdullah (my father) died and left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a matron who may teach them and bring them up with good manners."" The Prophet then said (to me), ""Go to your family."" When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling of the camel, he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and about what the Prophet had done to the camel and his hitting it. When the Prophet arrived, I went to him with the camel in the morning and he gave me its price, the camel itself, and my share from the war booty as he gave the other people."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     A man came to the Prophet and said, ""I am often betrayed in bargaining."" The Prophet advised him, ""When you buy something, say (to the seller), 'No deception."" The man used to say so afterwards."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba:                     The Prophet said, ""Allah has forbidden for you, (1) to be undutiful to your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters alive, (3) to not to pay the rights of the others (e.g. charity, etc.) and (4) to beg of men (begging). And Allah has hated for you (1) vain, useless talk, or that you talk too much about others, (2) to ask too many questions, (in disputed religious matters) and (3) to waste the wealth (by extravagance)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""Everyone of you is a guardian, and responsible for what is in his custody. The ruler is a guardian of his subjects and responsible for them; a husband is a guardian of his family and is responsible for it; a lady is a guardian of her husband's house and is responsible for it, and a servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for it."" I heard that from Allah's Apostle and I think that the Prophet also said, ""A man is a guardian of is father's property and is responsible for it, so all of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and things under your care."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     I heard a man reciting a verse (of the Holy Qur'an) but I had heard the Prophet reciting it differently.

The Jew went to the Prophet and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet sent for the Muslim and asked him about it. The Muslim informed him of the event. The Prophet said, ""Do not give me superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the first to gain consciousness, and will see Moses standing and holding the side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know whether (Moses) has also fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted him from that stroke."""

The Prophet asked who that was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet sent for him, and on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He (replied in the affirmative and) said, ""I heard him taking an oath in the market saying, 'By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the human beings.' I said, 'O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses superiority) even over Muhammad I became furious and slapped him over his face."" The Prophet said, ""Do not give a prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth, and will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the first unconsciousness was sufficient for him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones.

Al-Ash'ath said: By Allah, that saying concerned me. I had common land with a Jew, and the Jew later on denied my ownership, so I took him to the Prophet who asked me whether I had a proof of my ownership. When I replied in the negative, the Prophet asked the Jew to take an oath. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! He will take an oath and deprive me of my property."" So, Allah revealed the following verse: ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths."" (3.77)"

So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round his neck and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Apostle and said, ""I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me."" The Prophet ordered me to release him and asked Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, ""It was revealed in this way."" He then asked me to recite it.

When Allah's Apostle came up to him; he asked, ""What have you to say, O Thumama?"" He replied, ""I have good news, O Muhammad!"" Abu Huraira narrated the whole narration which ended with the order of the Prophet ""Release him!"""

On that the Divine revelation came:-- ""On those who believe And do good deeds There is no blame For what they ate (in the past)."" (5.93)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""Beware! Avoid sitting on he roads (ways)."" The people said, ""There is no way out of it as these are our sitting places where we have talks."" The Prophet said, ""If you must sit there, then observe the rights of the way."" They asked, ""What are the rights of the way?"" He said, ""They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, ""This dog is suffering from thirst as I did."" So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. The people said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving the animals?"" He replied: ""Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being)."" (See Hadith No. 551)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Usama bin Zaid:                     Once the Prophet stood at the top of one of the castles (or higher buildings) of Medina and said, ""Do you see what I see? No doubt I am seeing the spots of afflictions amongst your houses as numerous as the spots where raindrops fall (during a heavy rain). (See Hadith No. 102)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     I had been eager to ask `Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur'an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with `Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, ""O Chief of the believers! ' Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said: 'If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, ""I am astonished at your question, O Ibn `Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa."" Then `Umar went on relating the narration and said. ""I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in `Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.' Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, 'Does any of you keep Allah's Apostle angry all the day long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah's Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don't ask Allah's Apostle too many things, and don't retort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don't be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. `Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah's Apostle. In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah's Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.' So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you weeping? Didn't I warn you? Have Allah's Apostle divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't know. He is there in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: ""Will you get the permission of (Allah's Apostle) for `Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: ""Will you get he permission for `Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, ""Allah's Apostle has granted you permission."" So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: ""Have you divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: ""Will you heed what I say, 'O Allah's Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them..."" `Umar told the whole story (about his wife). ""On that the Prophet smiled."" `Umar further said, ""I then said, 'I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (`Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah's Apostle) ""Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?' The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, 'O Ibn Al-Khattab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked the Prophet . 'Please ask Allah's forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to `Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.' The Prophet said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That month consisted of twenty-nine days. `Aisha said, 'When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you need not hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents."" `Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said: 'O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.' (33.28) `Aisha said, 'Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.' After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as `Aisha did."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Allah's Apostle took an oath that he would not go to his wives for one month as his foot had been sprained. He stayed in an upper room when `Umar went to him and said, ""Have you divorced your wives?"" He said, ""No, but I have taken an oath that I would not go to them for one month."" The Prophet stayed there for twenty-nine days, and then came down and went to his wives."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     The Prophet entered the Mosque, and I too went there after tying the camel at the pavement of the Mosque.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""When an adulterer commits illegal sexual intercourse, then he is not a believer at the time, he is doing it, and when a drinker of an alcoholic liquor drinks it, then he is not a believer at the time of drinking it, and when a thief steals, then he is not a believer at the time of stealing, and when a robber robs, and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing robbery."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa`:                     On the day of Khaibar the Prophet saw fires being lighted. He asked, ""Why are these fires being lighted?""

The people said, ""Shall we throw away their contents and wash the pots (rather than break them)?"" He said, ""Wash them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Mas`ud:                     The Prophet entered Mecca and (at that time) there were three hundred-and-sixty idols around the Ka`ba. He started stabbing the idols with a stick he had in his hand and reciting: ""Truth (Islam) has come and Falsehood (disbelief) has vanished."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Al-Qasim:                     Aisha said that she hung a curtain decorated with pictures (of animals) on a cupboard. The Prophet tore that curtain and she turned it into two cushions which remained in the house for the Prophet to sit on.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""Whoever is killed while protecting his property then he is a martyr."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     While the Prophet was with one of his wives, one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of his wives) sent a wooden bowl containing food with a servant. The wife (in whose house he was sitting) stroke the bowl with her hand and broke it. The Prophet collected the shattered pieces and put the food back in it and said, ""Eat."" He kept the servant and the bowl till he had eaten the food. Then the Prophet gave another unbroken. bowl to the servant and kept the broken one."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There was an Israeli man called Juraij, while he was praying, his mother came and called him, but he did not respond to her call. He said (to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and called him and said, ""O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes."" Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; ""O boy! Who is your father?"" The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     ""Allah's Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish. Abu- 'Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu 'Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be one date only."" I said, ""How could one date benefit you?"" Jabir replied, ""We came to know its value when even that too finished."" Jabir added, ""When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen days. Then Abu 'Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama:                     Once the journey food diminished and the people were reduced to poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their camels, and he agreed. `Umar met them and they told him about it, and he said, ""How would you survive after slaughtering your camels?"" Then he went to the Prophet and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their camels?"" Allah's Apostle ordered `Umar, ""Call upon the people to bring what has remained of their food."" A leather sheet was spread and al I the journey food was collected and heaped over it. Allah's Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah's Apostle then said, ""I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij:                     We used to offer the `Asr prayer with the Prophet and slaughter a camel, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would eat the cooked meat before sunset."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet said, ""When the people of Ash`ari tribe ran short of food during the holy battles, or the food of their families in Medina ran short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl. So, these people are from me, and I am from them."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq wrote to him the law of Zakat which was made obligatory by Allah's Apostle. He wrote: 'Partners possessing joint property (sheep) have to pay its Zakat equally.
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Abaya bin Rafa'a bin Raft' bin Khadij:                     My grandfather said, ""We were in the company of the Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and slaughtered the animals and put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and Allah stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, ""Some of these animals are like wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e. shoot it with an arrow)."" Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather said, ""We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the animals with reeds?"" The Prophet said, ""Use whatever causes blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we should not imitate for they are infidels)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet decreed that one should not eat two dates together at a time unless he gets the permission from his companions (sharing the meal with him).
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabala:                     ""While at Medina we were struck with famine. Ibn Az-Zubair used to provide us with dates as our food. Ibn `Umar used to pass by us and say, ""Don't eat two dates together at a time as the Prophet has forbidden eating two dates together at a time (in a gathering) unless one takes the permission of one's companion brother."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Ibn `Umar said, ""Allah's Apostle said, 'If one manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other shares according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be completely manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.' "" (Aiyub, a sub-narrator is not sure whether the saying "" ... otherwise he will be partially manumitted"" was said by Nafi` or the Prophet.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him, then the price of the slave should be estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work and earn the amount that will manumit him (without overburdening him)""."
Sarah,30," Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of the person abiding by Allah's order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water, they had to go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them. So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:                     That he had asked `Aisha about the meaning of the Statement of Allah: ""If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four."" (4.3) She said, ""O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were ordered to marry any other woman."" `Aisha further said, ""After that verse the people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan 'girls), so Allah revealed the following verses:-- 'They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to marry..."" (4.127) What is meant by Allah's Saying:-- 'And about what is Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:-- 'If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) `Aisha said, ""Allah's saying in the other verse:--'Yet whom you desire to marry' (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet established the right of Shu'fa (i.e. Preemption) in joint properties; but when the land is divided and the ways are demarcated, then there is no pre-emption."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""The right of preemption is valid in every joint property, but when the land is divided and the way is demarcated, then there is no right of pre-emption."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sulaiman bin Abu Muslim:                     I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand. He said, ""I and a partner of mine bought something partly in cash and partly on credit."" Al-Bara' bin `Azib passed by us and we asked about it. He replied, ""I and my partner Zaid bin Al-Arqam did the same and then went to the Prophet and asked him about it. He said, 'Take what was from hand to hand and leave what was on credit.' """
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah:                     Allah's Apostle rented the land of Khaibar to the Jews on the condition that they would work on it and cultivate it and take half of its yield.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba bin 'Amir:                     that Allah's Apostle gave him some sheep to distribute among his companions in order to sacrifice them and a kid was left. He told the Prophet about it and the Prophet said to him, ""Sacrifice it on your behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Hisham:                     that his mother Zainab bint Humaid took him to the Prophet and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Take the pledge of allegiance from him."" But he said, ""He is still too young for the pledge,"" and passed his hand on his (i.e. `Abdullah's) head and invoked for Allah's blessing for him. Zuhra bin Ma`bad stated that he used to go with his grandfather, `Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff. Ibn `Umar and Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, ""Be our partner, as the Prophet invoked Allah to bless you."" So, he would be their partner, and very often he would win a camel's load and send it home."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever manumits his share o a jointly possessed slave, it is imperative on him to manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of its price which is to be estimated justly. He should pay his partners their shares and release him (the freed one)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, it is essential for him to manumit the slave completely if he has sufficient money. Otherwise he should look for some work for the slave (to earn what would enable him to emancipate himself), without overburdening him with work."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for `Umra and that we could finish our Ihram after performing the `Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, ""Shall we go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?"" Jabir moved his hand while saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, ""I have been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have finished the Ihram."" At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked ""O Allah's Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?"" The Prophet replied, ""It is forever."" In the meantime `Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, `Ali was saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah's Apostle's). The Prophet told him to keep on the Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:                     My grandfather, Rafi` bin Khadij said, ""We were in the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. Allah's Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots, and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and) a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah's Apostle said, 'Some of these animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then you should treat it as you have done now.' "" My grandfather said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals with reeds?"" The Prophet said, ""Yes, or you can use what would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don't use teeth or fingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     No doubt, the Prophet mortgaged his armor for barley grams. Once I took barley bread with some dissolved fat on it to the Prophet and I heard him saying, ""The household of Muhammad did not possess except a Sa (of food grain, barley, etc.) for both the morning and the evening meals although they were nine houses."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet bought some foodstuff on credit for a limited period and mortgaged his armor for it.

Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and) said, ""I will kill him."" So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka`b and said, ""I want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains."" Ka`b said, ""Mortgage your women to me."" Muhammad bin Maslama said, ""How can we mortgage our women, and you are the most handsome among the Arabs?"" He said, ""Then mortgage your sons to me."" Muhammad said, ""How can we mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them for being mortgaged for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we will mortgage our arms to you."" So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""One can ride the mortgaged animal because of what one spends on it, and one can drink the milk of a milch animal as long as it is mortgaged. """

I said, 'The defendant would not mind to take a false oath.""

Abu Huraira said, ""Indeed, I would like you to witness that I have manumitted him."" That happened at the time when Abu Huraira recited (the following poetic verse):-- 'What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us From the land of Kufr (disbelief)."

When Allah's Apostle went (to Mecca) at the time of the Conquest, Sa`d took the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a to Allah's Apostle and also brought 'Abu bin Zam`a with him and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! This is the son of my brother `Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody."" 'Abu bin Zam`a said, ""O Allah's Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam`a's slave-girl and he was born on his bed."" Allah's Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam`a and noticed much resemblance (to `Utba). Allah's Apostle said, ""It is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam`a as he was born on the bed of your father.""

The Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either staying with her husband or leaving him. She said, ""Even if he gave me so much money, I would not stay with him,"" and so she preferred her freedom to her husband."

The Prophet stood up and said to them, ""I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I have delayed their distribution."" The Prophet had waited for them for more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became evident to them that the Prophet was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, ""We choose our prisoners."" The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and said, ""Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives)."" The people unanimously said, ""We do that (return the captives) willingly."" The Prophet said, ""We do not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders forward us your decision."" So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly given their consent to return the captives.

The Prophet asked me, 'Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job)."

So, any condition which is not present in Allah's Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions. Allah's ordinance is the truth, and Allah's condition is stronger and more solid.

The Prophet asked her to send that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place in which you see now."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami:                     That his father said, ""One day I was sitting with some of the Prophet's companions on the way to Mecca. Allah's Apostle was ahead of us. All of my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand over to me the whip and the spear but they said, 'No, by Allah, we shall not help you in that in any way.' I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah's Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, 'Do you have a portion of it with you?' I replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy foreleg which he ate completely while he was in the state of Ihram ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Once Allah's Apostle visited us in this house of ours and asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and `Umar in front of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah's Apostle finished, `Umar said to Allah's Apostle ""Here is Abu Bakr."" But Allah's Apostle gave the remaining milk to the bedouin and said twice, ""The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the right side."" Anas added, ""It is a Sunna (the Prophet's traditions)"" and repeated it thrice."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah's Apostle. (The narrator confirms that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas, ""Did the Prophet; eat from it?"" Anas replied, ""He ate from it."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated As-Sa'b bin Jath-thama:                     An onager was presented to Allah's Apostle at the place called Al-Abwa' or Waddan, but Allah's Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the signs of sorrow on the giver's face he said, ""We have not rejected your gift, but we are in the state of Ihram."" (i.e. if we were not in a state of Ihram we would have accepted your gift, Fath-ul-Bari page 130, Vol. 6)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Aisha:                     The people used to look forward for the days of my (`Aisha's) turn to send gifts to Allah's Apostle in order to please him.
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     Ibn `Abbas said: Um Hufaid, Ibn `Abbas's aunt sent some dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn `Abbas said, ""The mastigar was eaten at the table of Allah's Apostle and if it had been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Allah's Apostle."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Whenever a meal was brought to Allah's Apostle, he would ask whether it was a gift or Sadaqa (something given in charity). If he was told that it was Sadaqa, he would tell his companions to eat it, but if it was a gift, he would hurry to share it with them."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Some meat was brought to the Prophet and it was said that the meat had been given in charity to Buraira. He said, ""It was Sadaqa for Buraira but a gift for us."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     I intended to buy Buraira but her masters stipulated that her Wala should be for them. When the Prophet was told about it, he said to me, ""Buy and manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator."" Once Buraira was given some meat, and the Prophet asked, ""What is this?"" I said, ""It has been given to Buraira in charity."" He said, ""It is sadaqa for her but a gift for us."" Buraira was given the option (to stay with her husband or to part with him). `Abdur-Rahman (a sub-narrator) wondered, ""Was her husband a slave or a free man?"" Shu`ba (another sub-narrator) said, ""I asked `Abdur-Rahman whether her husband was a slave or a free man. He replied that he did not know whether he was a slave or a free man."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Um 'Atiyya:                     Once the Prophet went to `Aisha and asked her whether she had something (to eat). She said that she had nothing except the mutton which Um 'Atiyya had sent to (Buraira) in charity. The Prophet said that it had reached its destination (i.e. it is no longer an object of charity.)
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The people used to send gifts to the Prophet on the day of my turn. Um Salama said: ""My companions (the wives of the Prophet Other than Aisha) gathered and they complained about it. So I informed the Prophet about it on their behalf, but he remained silent."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa from `Aisha:                     The wives of Allah's Apostle were in two groups. One group consisted of `Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama and the other wives of Allah's Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah's Apostle loved `Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah's Apostle, he would delay it, till Allah's Apostle had come to `Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to Allah's Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and decided that Um Salama should request Allah's Apostle to tell the people to send their gifts to him in whatever wife's house he was. Um Salama told Allah's Apostle of what they had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She said, ""He did not say anything to me."" They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, ""Talk to him till he gives you a reply."" When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to her, ""Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha."" On that Um Salama said, ""I repent to Allah for hurting you."" Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle and sent her to Allah's Apostle to say to him, ""Your wives request to treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms."" Then Fatima conveyed the message to him. The Prophet said, ""O my daughter! Don't you love whom I love?"" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh words saying, ""Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms."" On that she raised her voice and abused `Aisha to her face so much so that Allah's Apostle looked at `Aisha to see whether she would retort. `Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at `Aisha and said, ""She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr."""
Sarah,30," Narrated 'Azra bin Thabit Al-Ansari:                     When I went to Thumama bin `Abdullah, he gave me some perfume and said that Anas would not reject the gifts of perfume. Anas said: The Prophet used not to reject the gifts of perfume."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:                     When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet he stood up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and said, ""Then after: Your brethren have come to you with repentance and I see it logical to return to them their captives; so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you like to stick to his share till we give him his right from the very first Fai (war booty) (1) which Allah will bestow on us, then (he can do so)."" The people replied, ""We do that (to return the captives) willingly as a favor for your sake."""

Sarah,30," Narrated 'Amir:                     I heard An-Nu`man bin Bashir on the pulpit saying, ""My father gave me a gift but `Amra bint Rawaha (my mother) said that she would not agree to it unless he made Allah's Apostle as a witness to it. So, my father went to Allah's Apostle and said, 'I have given a gift to my son from `Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah's Apostle!' Allah's Apostle asked, 'Have you given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons?' He replied in the negative. Allah's Apostle said, 'Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.' My father then returned and took back his gift."""

He came out leaning on two men while his feet were dragging on the ground. He was walking between Al-`Abbas and another man."" 'Ubaidullah said, ""When I informed Ibn `Abbas of what `Aisha had said, he asked me whether I knew who was the second man whom `Aisha had not named. I replied in the negative.

The Prophet said, ""Give in charity and do not withhold it; otherwise Allah will withhold it back from you . """
Sarah,30," Narrated Asma:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Give (in charity) and do not give reluctantly lest Allah should give you in a limited amount; and do not withhold your money lest Allah should withhold it from you."""

On the day when it was her turn to be with the Prophet, she said, ""Do you know, O Allah's Apostle, that I have manumitted my slave-girl?"" He said, ""Have you really?"" She replied in the affirmative. He said, ""You would have got more reward if you had given her (i.e. the slave-girl) to one of your maternal uncles."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to go on a journey, he would draw lots as to which of his wives would accompany him.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     That he heard As-Sa'b bin Jath-thama Al-Laithi, who was one of the companions of the Prophet, saying that he gave the meat of an onager to Allah's Apostle while he was at a place called Al-Abwa' or Waddan, and was in a state of Ihram. The Prophet did not accept it. When the Prophet saw the signs of sorrow on As-Sa'b's face because of not accepting his present, he said (to him), ""We are not returning your present, but we are in the state of Ihram."" (See Hadith No. 747)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Humaid Al-Sa`idi:                     The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd, called Ibn 'Utbiyya for collecting the Zakat. When he returned he said, ""This (i.e. the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a present."" The Prophet said, ""Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or mother's house to see whether he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a sheep, it will be bleating.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     The Prophet said to me, ""I will give you so much (the Prophet pointed thrice with his hands) when funds of Bahrain will come to me."" But the Prophet died before the money reached him. (When it came) Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to announce that whoever had a money claim on the Prophet or was promised to be given something, should come to Abu Bakr.

He then asked him, ""Can you fast for two successive months continuously"" He replied in the negative. The Prophet then asked him, ""Can you feed sixty poor persons?"" He replied in the negative. In the meantime an Ansari came with a basket full of dates. The Prophet said to the man, ""Take it and give it in charity (as an expiation of your sin)."" The man said ""Should I give it to some people who are poorer than we O Allah's Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, there is no family between Medina's two mountains poorer than we.""

Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     My father was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud and his creditors demanded the debt back in a harsh manner. So I went to Allah's Apostle and informed him of that, he asked them to accept the fruits of my garden and excuse my father, but they refused. So, Allah's Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut them and distribute them among them, but said, ""I will come to you tomorrow morning."" So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to Allah's Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened.

He then added, ""Buy (a camel) of the same age and give it to him."" They said, ""We cannot get except a camel of an older age than that of his.""

When the Prophet had returned from Ta'if, he waited for them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, ""Then after: These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e. war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so."" The people said, ""We return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah's Apostle!"" The Prophet said, ""I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and your leaders may present your decision to me.""

He asked, ""Do you lend them so that their milk may be utilized by others?"" The bedouin said, ""Yes."" The Prophet asked, ""Do you milk them on the day off watering them?"" He replied, ""Yes."" The Prophet said, ""Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any of your deeds."" (See Hadith No. 260, Vol. 5)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Tawus:                     That he was told by the most learned one amongst them (i.e. Ibn `Abbas) that the Prophet went towards some land which was flourishing with vegetation and asked to whom it belonged. He was told that such and such a person took it on rent. The Prophet said, ""It would have been better (for the owner) if he had given it to him gratis rather than charging him a fixed rent."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""The Prophet Abraham migrated with Sarah. The people (of the town where they migrated) gave her Ajar (i.e. Hajar).

Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab:                     Once I gave a horse (for riding) in Allah's Cause. Later I saw it being sold. I asked Allah's Apostle (whether I could buy it). He said, ""Don't buy it, for you should not get back what you have given in charity."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Al-Musaiyab Alqama bin Waqqas and Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah:                     About the story of `Aisha and their narrations were similar attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about `Aisha, and the Divine Inspiration was delayed, Allah's Apostle sent for `Ali and Usama to consult them in divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama said, ""Keep your wife, as we know nothing about her except good."" Buraira said, ""I cannot accuse her of any defect except that she is still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family's dough which the domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband)."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not known about my family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not know anything except good."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle and Ubai bin Ka`b Al-Ansari went to the garden where Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah's Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the date108 palms as he wanted to hear secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft decorated sheet was lying on his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet hiding behind the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, ""O Saf, this is Muhammad."" Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious), the Prophet said, ""If she had left him undisturbed, he would have revealed his reality."" (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     The wife of Rifa`a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said, ""I was Rifa`a's wife, but he divorced me and it was a final irrevocable divorce. Then I married `Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent."" The Prophet asked her 'Do you want to remarry Rifa`a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your present husband."" Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah's Apostle and Khalid bin Sa`id bin Al-`As was at the door waiting to be admitted.

He then sent someone to the house of Abu Ihab to inquire about that but they did not know that she had suckled their daughter. Then `Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it. The Prophet said to him, ""How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that both of you were suckled by the same woman)?"" So, he divorced her and she was married to another (husband)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar bin Al-Khattab:                     People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle but now there is no longer any more (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice publicly, so we will trust and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account about what he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but we will not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that his intentions were good."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, ""It has been affirmed (Paradise).""

You said it has been affirmed for both?"" The Prophet said, ""The testimony of the people (is accepted), (for) the believer are Allah's witnesses on the earth."""

The people praised the deceased. `Umar said, ""It has been affirmed."" (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. `Umar said, ""It has been affirmed (Paradise)."" Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people talked badly of the deceased. `Umar said, ""It has been affirmed (Hell)."" I asked `Umar, ""O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?"" He said, ""I have said what the Prophet said. He said, 'Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good character is attested by four persons.' We asked the Prophet, 'If there were three witnesses only?' He said, 'Even three.' We asked, 'If there were two only?' He said, 'Even two.' But we did not ask him about one witness."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow him. He said, ""Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?"" `Aisha said, ""How is that?"" Aflah replied, ""You were suckled by my brother's wife with my brother's milk."" I asked Allah's Apostle about it, and he said, ""Aflah is right, so permit him to visit you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said about Hamza's daughter, ""I am not legally permitted to marry her, as foster relations are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs). She is the daughter of my foster brother."""

I think the man is Hafsa's foster uncle.' "" `Aisha added, ""O Allah's Apostle! There is a man asking the permission to enter your house."" Allah's Apostle replied, ""I think the man is Hafsa's foster uncle."" `Aisha said, ""If so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster uncle) would he be allowed to visit me?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""Yes, he would, as the foster relations are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Once the Prophet came to me while a man was in my house. He said, ""O `Aisha! Who is this (man)?"" I replied, ""My foster brothers"" He said, ""O `Aisha! Be sure about your foster brothers, as fostership is only valid if it takes place in the suckling period (before two years of age)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:                     A woman committed theft in the Ghazwa of the Conquest (of Mecca) and she was taken to the Prophet who ordered her hand to be cut off. `Aisha said, ""Her repentance was perfect and she was married (later) and used to come to me (after that) and I would present her needs to Allah's Apostle."""

Sarah,30," Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir:                     My mother asked my father to present me a gift from his property; and he gave it to me after some hesitation. My mother said that she would not be satisfied unless the Prophet was made a witness to it. I being a young boy, my father held me by the hand and took me to the Prophet . He said to the Prophet, ""His mother, bint Rawaha, requested me to give this boy a gift."" The Prophet said, ""Do you have other sons besides him?"" He said, ""Yes."" The Prophet said, ""Do not make me a witness for injustice."" Narrated Ash-Shu`bi that the Prophet said, ""I will not become a witness for injustice."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zahdam bin Mudrab:                     I heard `Imran bin Husain saying, ""The Prophet said, 'The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and then those coming after (the second generation)."" `Imran said ""I do not know whether the Prophet mentioned two or three generations after your present generation. The Prophet added, 'There will be some people after you, who will be dishonest and will not be trustworthy and will give witness (evidences) without being asked to give witness, and will vow but will not fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""The people of my generation are the best, then those who follow them, and then whose who follow the latter. After that there will come some people whose witness will go ahead of their oaths, and their oaths will go ahead of their witness."" Ibrahim (a sub-narrator) said, ""We used to be beaten for taking oaths by saying, 'I bear witness by the Name of Allah or by the Covenant of Allah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet was asked about the great sins He said, ""They are:-- (1 ) To join others in worship with Allah, (2) To be undutiful to one's parents. (3) To kill a person (which Allah has forbidden to kill) (i.e. to commit the crime of murdering). (4) And to give a false witness."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakra:                     The Prophet said thrice, ""Should I inform you out the greatest of the great sins?"" They said, ""Yes, O Allah's Apostle!"" He said, ""To join others in worship with Allah and to be undutiful to one's parents."" The Prophet then sat up after he had been reclining (on a pillow) and said, ""And I warn you against giving a false witness, and he kept on saying that warning till we thought he would not stop. (See Hadith No. 7, Vol. 8)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The Prophet heard a man (reciting Qur'an) in the Mosque, and he said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy upon him. No doubt, he made me remember such-and such Verses of such-and-such Sura which I dropped (from my memory). Narrated Aisha: The Prophet performed the Tahajjud prayer in my house, and then he heard the voice of `Abbad who was praying in the Mosque, and said, ""O `Aisha! Is this `Abbad's voice?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""O Allah! Be merciful to `Abbad!"""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     The Prophet said, ""Bilal pronounces the Adhan when it is still night (before dawn), so eat and drink till the next Adhan is pronounced (or till you hear Ibn Um Maktum's Adhan)."" Ibn Um Maktum was a blind man who would not pronounce the Adhan till he was told that it was dawn."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:                     Some outer garments were received the Prophet and my father (Makhrama) said to me, ""Let us go to the Prophet so that he may give us something from the garments."" So, my father stood at the door and spoke. The Prophet recognized his voice and came out carrying a garment and telling Makhrama the good qualities of that garment, adding, ""I have kept this for you, I have sent this for you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?"" The women said, ""Yes."" He said, ""This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith:                     That he had married Um Yahya bint Abu Ihab. He said. ""A black slave-lady came and said, 'I suckled you both.' I then mentioned that to the Prophet who turned his face aside."" `Uqba further said, ""I went to the other side and told the Prophet about it. He said, 'How can you (keep her as your wife) when the lady has said that she suckled both of you (i.e. you and your wife?)"" So, the Prophet ordered him to divorce her."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba bin Al-Harith:                     I married a woman and later on a woman came and said, ""I suckled you both."" So, I went to the Prophet (to ask him about it). He said, ""How can you (keep her as a wife) when it has been said (that you were foster brother and sister)? Leave (divorce) her."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) ""Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allah's Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allah's Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, ""Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him)."" He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah's Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allah's Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, 'What are the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.' I said, 'Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter?' That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allah's Apostle called `Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. `Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Allah's Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.' `Ali bin Abu Talib said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that Allah's Apostle called Buraira and said, 'O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah's Apostle said, 'Who will support me to punish that person (`Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh got up and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sa`d bin 'Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him.' On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sa`d bin 'Ubada), 'By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allah's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quieted them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah's Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, 'O `Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' When Allah's Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah's Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle.' I said to my mother, 'Talk to Allah's Apostle on my behalf.' She said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Qur'an. I said. 'I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I don't compare my situation with you except to the situation of Joseph's father (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur'an. I had hoped that Allah's Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah's Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah's Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, `Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.' My mother told me to go to Allah's Apostle . I replied, 'By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.' So Allah revealed: ""Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . ."" (24.11) When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.' But Allah later revealed: -- ""And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."" (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, 'Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Allah's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife about me saying, 'What do you know and what did you see?' She replied, 'O Allah's Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha."" Aisha further added ""Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet's love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Bakra:                     A man praised another man in front of the Prophet . The Prophet said to him, ""Woe to you, you have cut off your companion's neck, you have cut off your companion's neck,"" repeating it several times and then added, ""Whoever amongst you has to praise his brother should say, 'I think that he is so and so, and Allah knows exactly the truth, and I do not confirm anybody's good conduct before Allah, but I think him so and so,' if he really knows what he says about him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari:                     The Prophet heard someone praising another and exaggerating in his praise. The Prophet said, ""You have ruined or cut the man's back (by praising him so much)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle called me to present myself in front of him or the eve of the battle of Uhud, while I was fourteen years of age at that time, and he did not allow me to take part in that battle, but he called me in front of him on the eve of the battle of the Trench when I was fifteen years old, and he allowed me (to join the battle)."" Nafi` said, ""I went to `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz who was Caliph at that time and related the above narration to him, He said, ""This age (fifteen) is the limit between childhood and manhood,"" and wrote to his governors to give salaries to those who reached the age of fifteen."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""Bath on Friday is compulsory for those who have attained the age of puberty."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If somebody takes a false oath in order to get the property of a Muslim (unjustly) by that oath, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him."" Al-Ash'ath informed me, ""By Allah! This was said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece of land between me and a man from the Jews who denied my right. I took him to the Prophet. Allah's Apostle asked me, 'Do you have an evidence?' I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, 'Take an oath.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! He will surely take an oath and take my property unjustly."" So, Allah revealed: ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths . . . "" (3.77)"
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:                     Ibn `Abbas wrote that the Prophet gave his verdict on the basis of the defendant's oath.
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wail:                     `Abdullah (bin Mas`ud) said, ""Whoever takes a (false) oath in order to grab some property (unjustly), Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him. Allah confirmed that through His Divine Revelation: ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths . . . they will have a painful punishment."" (3.77) Al-Ash'ath bin Qais came to us and asked, 'What is Abu `Abdur-Rahman (i.e. `Abdullah) telling you? 'We told him what he was narrating to us. He said, 'He was telling the truth; this Divine Verse was revealed in connection with me. There was a dispute between me and another man about something and the case was filed before Allah's Apostle who said, 'Produce your two witnesses or else the defendant is to take an oath.' I said, The defendant will surely take a (false) oath caring for nothing.' The Prophet said, 'Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab (other's) property, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him.' Then Allah revealed its confirmation. Al-Ashath then recited the above Divine Verse."" (3.77)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife before the Prophet of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma.' The Prophet said, ""Produce a proof, or else you would get the legal punishment (by being lashed) on your back."" Hilal said, ""O Allah's Apostle! If anyone of us saw another man over his wife, would he go to search for a proof."" The Prophet went on saying, ""Produce a proof or else you would get the legal punishment (by being lashed) on your back."" The Prophet then mentioned the narration of Lian (as in the Holy Book). (Surat-al-Nur: 24)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There are three persons whom Allah will neither talk to nor look at, nor purify from (the sins), and they will have a painful punishment. (They are): (1) A man possessed superfluous water on a way and he withheld it from the travelers. (2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to a Muslim ruler and gives it only for worldly gains. If the ruler gives him what he wants, he remains obedient to It, otherwise he does not abide by it, and (3) a man bargains with another man after the `Asr prayer and the latter takes a false oath in the Name of Allah) claiming that he has been offered so much for the thing and the former (believes him and) buys it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn Mas`ud:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever takes a (false) oath in order to grab (others) property, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet Him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet asked some people to take an oath, and they hurried for it. The Prophet ordered that lots should be drawn amongst them as to who would take an oath first."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abu `Aufa:                     A man displayed some goods in the market and took a false oath that he had been offered so much for them though he was not offered that amount Then the following Divine Verse was revealed:-- ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's covenant and their oaths . . . Will get painful punishment."" (3.77) Ibn Abu `Aufa added, ""Such person as described above is a treacherous Riba eater (i.e. eater of usury)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Wail from `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever takes a false oath in order to grab another man's (or his brother's) property, then Allah will be angry with him when he will meet him."" Then Allah confirmed this by revealing the Divine Verse: ""Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oaths . . . Will get painful punishment."" (3.77) Al-Ash'ath met me and asked, ""What did `Abdullah tell you today?"" I said, ""So and so."" He said, ""The Verse was revealed regarding my case."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:                     A man came to Allah's Apostle asking him about Islam, Allah's Apostle said, ""You have to offer five compulsory prayers in a day and a night (24 hours)."" The man asked, ""Is there any more compulsory prayers for me?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""No, unless you like to offer Nawafil (i.e. optional prayers)."" Allah's Apostle then added, ""You have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan."" The man said, ""Am I to fast any other days?' Allah's Apostle said, ""No, unless you wish to observe the optional fast voluntarily."" Then Allah's Apostle told him about the compulsory Zakat. The man asked, ""Do I have to give anything besides?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""No, unless you wish to give in charity voluntarily."" So, the man departed saying, ""By Allah I will neither do more nor less than that."" Allah's Apostle said, ""If he has said the truth he will be successful."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever has to take an oath should swear by Allah or remain silent."" (i.e. He should not swear by other than Allah.)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Salama:                     Once Allah's Apostle said, ""You people present your cases to me and some of you may be more eloquent and persuasive in presenting their argument. So, if I give some one's right to another (wrongly) because of the latter's (tricky) presentation of the case, I am really giving him a piece of fire; so he should not take it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     Abu Sufyan told me that Heraclius said to him, ""When I inquired you what he (i.e. Muhammad) ordered you, you replied that he ordered you to establish the prayer, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises and to pay back trusts."" Then Heraclius added, ""These are really the qualities of a prophet."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""The signs of a hypocrite are three: (1) whenever he speaks, he tells a lie, (2) whenever he is entrusted, he proves to be dishonest, (3) whenever he promises, he breaks his promise."
Sarah,30," Narrated Muhammad bin `Ali:                     Jabir bin `Abdullah said, ""When the Prophet died, Abu Bakr received some property from Al-`Ala bin Al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said to the people, ""Whoever has a money claim on the Prophet, or was promised something by him, should come to us (so that we may pay him his right)."" Jabir added, ""I said (to Abu Bakr), Allah's Apostle promised me that he would give me this much, and this much, and this much (spreading his hands three times)."" Jabir added, ""Abu Bakr counted for me and handed me five-hundred (gold pieces), and then five-hundred, and then five-hundred."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     A Jew from Hira asked me which one of the two periods Musa (i.e. Prophet Moses) completed. I said, ""I don't know, (but wait) till I see the most learned 'Arab and inquire him about it."" So, I went to Ibn `Abbas and asked him. He replied, ""Moses completed the longer and better period."" Ibn `Abbas added, ""No doubt, an apostle of Allah always does what he says."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ubaidullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utba:                     Ibn `Abbas said, ""O Muslims? How do you ask the people of the Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Qur'an) which was revealed to His Prophet is the most recent information from Allah and you recite it, the Book that has not been distorted? Allah has revealed to you that the people of the scriptures have changed with their own hands what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit thereby."" Ibn `Abbas added: ""Isn't the knowledge revealed to you sufficient to prevent you from asking them? By Allah I have never seen any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has been revealed to you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated An-Nu`man bin Bashir:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of the person abiding by Allah's orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Allah's limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an ax and started making a hole in the bottom of the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), 'What is wrong with you?' He replied, ""You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have to get water.' Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves, but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Al-Ala:                     That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of `Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, ""Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Allah's Apostle came to our house and I said, (addressing the dead `Uthman), 'O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Allah be merciful to you. I testify that Allah has blessed you.' The Prophet said to me, ""How do you know that Allah has blessed him?"" I replied, 'I do not know O Allah's Apostle! May my parents be sacrificed for you.' Allah's Apostle said, 'As regards `Uthman, by Allah he has died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Allah, although I am Allah's Apostle, I do not know what will be done to him.' Um Al- Ala added, 'By Allah I shall never attest the piety of anybody after him. And what Allah's Apostles said made me sad."" Um Al-Ala further said, ""Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for `Uthman. So I went to Allah's Apostle and told him about it, he said, 'That is (the symbol of) his deeds."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot fell. He also used to fix for everyone of his wives a day and a night, but Sauda bint Zam`a gave her day and night to `Aisha, the wife of the Prophet intending thereby to please Allah's Apostle."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If the people knew what is the reward of making the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except by casting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, they would race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and `Isha prayers, they would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there."
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani `Amr bin `Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, ""The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""Yes, you wish."" So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him. The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, ""O people! When something happens to you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Allah', (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     It was said to the Prophet ""Would that you see `Abdullah bin Ubai."" So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached `Abdullah bin Ubai, the latter said, ""Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has harmed me."" On that an Ansari man said (to `Abdullah), ""By Allah! The smell of the donkey of Allah's Apostle is better than your smell."" On that a man from `Abdullah's tribe got angry for `Abdullah's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- ""And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between them."" (49.9)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Kulthum bint `Uqba:                     That she heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     Once the people of Quba fought with each other till they threw stones on each other. When Allah's Apostle was informed about it, he said, ""Let us go to bring about a reconciliation between them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     The following Verse: If a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part (i.e. the husband notices something unpleasant about his wife, such as old age or the like, and wants to divorce her, but she asks him to keep her and provide for her as he wishes). (4.128) ""There is no blame on them if they reconcile on such basis."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:                     A bedouin came and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah's Laws."" His opponent got up and said, ""He is right. Judge between us according to Allah's Laws."" The bedouin said, ""My son was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the learned scholars who said, ""Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to be exiled for one year."" The Prophet said, ""No doubt I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile."" He then addressed somebody, ""O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death"" So, Unais went and stoned her to death."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If somebody innovates something which is not in harmony with the principles of our religion, that thing is rejected."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara bin `Azib:                     When Allah's Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the people of Hudaibiya, `Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it, ""Muhammad, Allah's Apostle ."" The pagans said, ""Don't write: 'Muhammad, Allah's Apostle', for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you."" Allah's Apostle asked `Ali to rub it out, but `Ali said, ""I will not be the person to rub it out."" Allah's Apostle rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that the Prophet and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that they would enter with their weapons in cases."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     When the Prophet intended to perform `Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 'These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah's Apostle agreed (to make peace).' They said, ""We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" The Prophet said, ""I am Allah's Apostle and also Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" Then he said to `Ali, ""Rub off (the words) 'Allah's Apostle' "", but `Ali said, ""No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name."" So, Allah's Apostle took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muhammad bin `Abdullah has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.' When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the Meccans went to `Ali and said, ""Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed."" So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, ""O Uncle! O Uncle!"" `Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, ""Take your uncle's daughter."" Zaid and Ja`far quarreled about her. `Ali said, ""I have more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter."" Ja`far said, ""She is my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife."" Zaid said, ""She is my brother's daughter."" The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 'All, ""You are from me and I am from you"", and said to Ja`far, ""You resemble me both in character and appearance"", and said to Zaid, ""You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib (ra):                      On the day of Hudaibiya, the Prophet (), the Prophet () made a peace treaty with the Al-Mushrikun on three conditions:1. The Prophet () would return to them any person from Al-Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, pagans).2. Al-Mushrikun pagans would not return any of the Muslims going to them, and 3. The Prophet () and his companions would come to Makkah the following year and would stay there for three days and would enter with their weapons in cases, e.g., swords, arrows, bows, etc.Abu Jandal came hopping, his legs being chained, but the Prophet () returned him to Al-Mushrikun."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle set out for the `Umra but the pagans of Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka`ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform `Umra the following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the period they allowed. So, the Prophet performed the `Umra in the following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed."
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl bin Abu Hathma:                     `Abdullah bin Sahl and Muhaiyisa bin Mas`ud bin Zaid went to Khaibar when it had a peace treaty (with the Muslims).
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl, and the relatives of Ar-Rabi` requested the girl's relatives to accept the Irsh (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but they refused. So, they went to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked, ""O Allah""; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi` be broken? No, by Him Who has sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken."" The Prophet said, ""O Anas! Allah""; law ordains retaliation."" Later the relatives of the girl agreed and forgave her. The Prophet said, ""There are some of Allah's slaves who, if they take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas added, ""The people agreed and accepted the Irsh."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Hasan Al-Basri:                     By Allah, Al-Hasan bin `Ali led large battalions like mountains against Muawiya. `Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), ""I surely see battalions which will not turn back before killing their opponents."" Muawiya who was really the best of the two men said to him, ""O `Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?"" Then Muawiya sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of `Abd-i-Shams called `Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and `Abdullah bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, ""Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him."" So, they went to Al-Hasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, ""We, the offspring of `Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and money only will appease them)."" They said to Al-Hasan, ""Muawiya offers you so and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace."" Al-Hasan said to them, ""But who will be responsible for what you have said?"" They said, ""We will be responsible for it."" So, whatever Al- Hasan asked they said, ""We will be responsible for it for you."" So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya. Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, ""I saw Allah's Apostle on the pulpit and Al-Hasan bin `Ali was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people and once at Al-Hasan bin `Ali saying, 'This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Aisha:                     Once Allah's Apostle heard the loud voices of some opponents quarreling at the door. One of them was appealing to the other to deduct his debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying, ""By Allah I will not do so."" Allah's Apostle went out to them and said, ""Who is the one who was swearing by Allah that he would not do a favor?"" That man said, ""I am that person, O Allah's Apostle! I will give my opponent whatever he wishes."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b bin Malik from Ka`b bin Malik:                     `Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Ka`b bin Malik some money. One day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices grew very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, ""O Ka`b,"" beckoning with his hand as if intending to say, ""Deduct half the debts."" So, Ka`b took half what the other owed him and remitted the other half."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There is a Sadaqa to be given for every joint of the human body; and for every day on which the sun rises there is a reward of a Sadaqa (i.e. charitable gift) for the one who establishes justice among people."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:                     Az-Zubair told me that he quarreled with an Ansari man who had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah's Apostle about a water stream which both of them used for irrigation. Allah's Apostle said to Az-Zubair, ""O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor."" The Ansari became angry and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Is it because he is your cousin?"" On that the complexion of Allah's Apostle changed (because of anger) and said (to Az-Zubair), ""I irrigate (your garden) and then withhold the water till it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms)."" So, Allah's Apostle gave Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Allah's Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah's Apostle he gave Az-Zubair his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, ""By Allah ! I think the following Verse was revealed concerning that case: ""But no by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them."" (4.65)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), ""When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah's Apostle)."" Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and `Umar and sat on the dates and invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, ""Call your creditors and give them their full rights."" So, I paid all my father's creditors in full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah's Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On that he smiled and said, ""Go to Abu Bakr and `Umar and tell them about it."" They said, ""We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah's Apostle did what he did."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Ka`b:                     That Ka`b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew louder till Allah's Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he lifted the curtain of his room and called Ka`b bin Malik saying, ""O Ka`b!"" He replied, ""Labbaik! O Allah's Apostle!"" He beckoned to him with his hand suggesting that he deduct half the debt. Ka`b said, ""I agree, O Allah's Apostle!"" Allah's Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), ""Get up and pay him the rest."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama:                     (from the companions of Allah's Apostle) When Suhail bin `Amr agreed to the Treaty (of Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin `Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kulthum bint `Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Allah's Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: ""O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                      Aisha told me, ""Allah's Apostle used to examine them according to this Verse: ""O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (60.10-12) Aisha said, ""When any of them agreed to that condition Allah's Apostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your pledge of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, by Allah he never touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words (only)."
Sarah,30, Narrated Jarir:                     When I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle and he stipulated that I should give good advice to every Muslim.
Sarah,30, Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah's Apostle for offering the prayers perfectly paying the Zakat and giving good advice to every Muslim.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""If someone sells pollinated date-palms, their fruits will be for the seller, unless the buyer stipulates the contrary."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for emancipation and at that time she had not paid any part of her price. `Aisha said to her, ""Go to your masters and if they agree that I will pay your price (and free you) on condition that your Wala' will be for me, I will pay the money."" Buraira told her masters about that, but they refused, and said, ""If `Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your Wala will be for us."" Aisha informed Allah's Apostle of that and he said to her, ""Buy and manumit Buraira as the Wala' will go to the manumitted."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and beat it and prayed for Allah's Blessings for it. The camel became so fast as it had never been before. The Prophet then said, ""Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold)."" I said, ""No."" He again said, ""Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold)."" I sold it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and when I went to him) he said, ""I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift for you."" (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to Medina)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Ansar said to the Prophet, ""Divide our date-palms between us and our emigrant brothers."" The Prophet said, ""No."" The Ansar said to the emigrants, ""You may do the labor (in our gardens) and we will share the fruits with you."" The emigrants said, ""We hear and obey."""
Sarah,30, Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jews on the condition that they would work on it and cultivate it and they would get half of its yield.
Sarah,30," Narrated `Uqba bin Amir:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""From among all the conditions which you have to fulfill, the conditions which make it legal for you to have sexual relations (i.e. the marriage contract) have the greatest right to be fulfilled."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Rafi` bin Khadij:                     We used to work on the fields more than the other Ansar, and we used to rent the land (for the yield of a specific portion of it). But sometimes that portion or the rest of the land did not give any yield, so we were forbidden (by the Prophet ) to follow such a system, but we were allowed to rent the land for money."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not practice Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you do not want to buy, in order to deceive the people). No Muslim should offer more for a thing already bought by his Muslim brother, nor should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim. A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister (i.e. another Muslim woman) in order to take her place herself."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:                     A bedouin came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's apostle! I ask you by Allah to judge My case according to Allah's Laws."" His opponent, who was more learned than he, said, ""Yes, judge between us according to Allah's Laws, and allow me to speak."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Speak."" He (i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, ""My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death."" Allah's Apostle said, ""By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death."" Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death."
Sarah,30," Narrated Aiman Al-Makki:                     When I visited Aisha she said, ""Buraira who had a written contract for her emancipation for a certain amount came to me and said, ""O mother of the believers! Buy me and manumit me, as my masters will sell me."" Aisha agreed to it. Buraira said, 'My masters will sell me on the condition that my Wala will go to them."" Aisha said to her, 'Then I am not in need of you.' The Prophet heard of that or was told about it and so he asked Aisha, 'What is the problem of Buraira?' He said, 'Buy her and manumit her, no matter what they stipulate.' Aisha added, 'I bought and manumitted her, though her masters had stipulated that her Wala would be for them.' The Prophet said, The Wala is for the liberator, even if the other stipulated a hundred conditions."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle forbade (1) the meeting of the caravan (of goods) on the way, (2) and that a residing person buys for a bedouin, (3) and that a woman stipulates the divorce of the wife of the would-be husband, (4) and that a man tries to cause the cancellation of a bargain concluded by another. He also forbade An-Najsh (see Hadith 824) and that one withholds the milk in the udder of the animal so that he may deceive people on selling it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Moses the Apostle of Allah,"" and then he narrated the whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, ""Did not I tell you that you can have no patience with me."" (18.72). Moses then violated the agreement for the first time because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything, the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied. The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses: ""Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me."" (18.73) ""Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him."" (18.74) ""Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of falling and Khadir set it up straight."" (18.77)"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa:                     Aisha said, ""Buraira came to me and said, 'My people (masters) have written the contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be paid in yearly installments, one Uqiyya per year; so help me."" Aisha said (to her), ""If your masters agree, I will pay them the whole sum provided the Wala will be for me."" Buraira went to her masters and told them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from them while Allah's Apostles was sitting. She said, ""I presented the offer to them, but they refused unless the Wala' would be for them."" When the Prophet heard that and `Aisha told him about It, he said to her, ""Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for them, as the Wala' is for the manumitted."" `Aisha did so. After that Allah's Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said, ""What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah's Laws? Any condition which is not in Allah's Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such conditions. Allah's Rules are the most valid and Allah's Conditions are the most solid. The Wala is for the manumitted."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     When the people of Khaibar dislocated `Abdullah bin `Umar's hands and feet, `Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, ""No doubt, Allah's Apostle made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and said to them, 'We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah allows you.' Now `Abdullah bin `Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them."" When `Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq's came and addressed `Umar, ""O chief of the believers, will you exile us although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?"" `Umar said, ""Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah's Apostle, i.e.: What will your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?"" The Jew replied, ""That was joke from Abul-Qasim."" `Umar said, ""O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie."" `Umar then drove them out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddles and ropes, etc."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:                     (whose narrations attest each other) Allah's Apostle set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, ""Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right."" By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, ""Al-Qaswa' (i.e. the she-camel's name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa' has become stubborn!"" The Prophet said, ""Al-Qaswa' has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant."" Then he said, ""By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them."" The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to Allah's Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al- Khuza`i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza`a and they were the advisers of Allah's Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, ""I left Ka`b bin Luai and 'Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Ka`ba."" Allah's Apostle said, ""We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the `Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e. the 'Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious."" Budail said, ""I will inform them of what you have said."" So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, ""We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to you if you should like."" Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said, ""Relate what you heard him saying."" Budail said, ""I heard him saying so-and-so,"" relating what the Prophet had told him. `Urwa bin Mas`ud got up and said, ""O people! Aren't you the sons? They said, ""Yes."" He added, ""Am I not the father?"" They said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Do you mistrust me?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Don't you know that I invited the people of `Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?"" They said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it and allow me to meet him."" They said, ""You may meet him."" So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then `Urwa said, ""O Muhammad! Won't you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone."" Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, ""Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?"" `Urwa said, ""Who is that man?"" They said, ""He is Abu Bakr."" `Urwa said to Abu Bakr, ""By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you."" `Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever `Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to `Urwa), ""Remove your hand from the beard of Allah's Apostle."" `Urwa raised his head and asked, ""Who is that?"" The people said, ""He is Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba."" `Urwa said, ""O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?"" Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him, ""As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). `Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah's Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. `Urwa returned to his people and said, ""O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An- Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect."" `Urwa added, ""No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it."" A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, ""Allow me to go to him,"" and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allah's Apostle said, ""He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of him."" So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, ""Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka`ba."" When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka`ba."" Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, ""Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man."" Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin `Amr came. When Suhail bin `Amr came, the Prophet said, ""Now the matter has become easy."" Suhail said to the Prophet ""Please conclude a peace treaty with us."" So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, ""Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful."" Suhail said, ""As for 'Beneficent,' by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously."" The Muslims said, ""By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful."" The Prophet said, ""Write: By Your Name O Allah."" Then he dictated, ""This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah's Apostle has concluded."" Suhail said, ""By Allah, if we knew that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Ka`ba, and would not fight with you. So, write: ""Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" The Prophet said, ""By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin `Abdullah."" (Az-Zuhri said, ""The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his companions perform `Umra.)"" The Prophet said to Suhail, ""On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka`ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it."" Suhail said, ""By Allah, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year."" So, the Prophet got that written. Then Suhail said, ""We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion."" The Muslims said, ""Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin `Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, ""O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me."" The Prophet said, ""The peace treaty has not been written yet."" Suhail said, ""I will never allow you to keep him."" The Prophet said, ""Yes, do."" He said, ""I won't do.: Mikraz said, ""We allow you (to keep him)."" Abu Jandal said, ""O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?"" (continued...) (continuing... 1): -3.891:... ... Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, ""I went to the Prophet and said, 'Aren't you truly the Apostle of Allah?' The Prophet said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, 'Isn't our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'I am Allah's Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' "" `Umar further said, ""I went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Isn't he truly Allah's Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Allah's Apostle and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we would go to the Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the Ka`ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, ""You will go to Ka`ba and perform Tawaf around it."" (Az-Zuhri said, "" `Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I asked them.' "") When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah's Apostle said to his companions, ""Get up and' slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved."" By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people's attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, ""O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head."" So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:-- ""O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them . . ."" (60.10) `Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaiya married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), ""Abide by the promise you gave us."" So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, ""By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword."" The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, ""By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried it many times."" Abu Basir said, ""Let me have a look at it."" When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah's Apostle saw him he said, ""This man appears to have been frightened."" When he reached the Prophet he said, ""My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too."" Abu Basir came and said, ""O Allah's Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me from them."" The Prophet said, ""Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only have supporters."" When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine Verses: ""And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. ... the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts ... the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance."" (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to write: ""In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,"" and they (the mushriks) prevented them (the Muslims) from visiting the House (the Ka`bah)."
Sarah,30,"  Narrated Az-Zuhri:                      `Urwa said, ""Aisha told me that Allah's Apostle used to examine the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their wives, `Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza`i. Later on Mu'awiya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other."" When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah revealed: ""And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr)."" (60.11) So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to return Abu Basir."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle mentioned a person who asked an Israeli man to lend him one-thousand Dinars, and the Israeli lent him the sum for a certain fixed period."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amra:                     Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation. `Aisha said to her, ""If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala' will be for me."" When Allah's Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said to her, ""Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits."" Then Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, ""What about those people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah's Laws? Whoever stipulates such conditions as are not in Allah's Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he stipulated a hundred such conditions."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""Allah has ninety-nine names, i.e. one-hundred minus one, and whoever knows them will go to Paradise."" (Please see Hadith No. 419 Vol. 8)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Umar bin Khattab got some land in Khaibar and he went to the Prophet to consult him about it saying, ""O Allah's Apostle I got some land in Khaibar better than which I have never had, what do you suggest that I do with it?"" The Prophet said, ""If you like you can give the land as endowment and give its fruits in charity."" So `Umar gave it in charity as an endowment on the condition that would not be sold nor given to anybody as a present and not to be inherited, but its yield would be given in charity to the poor people, to the Kith and kin, for freeing slaves, for Allah's Cause, to the travelers and guests; and that there would be no harm if the guardian of the endowment ate from it according to his need with good intention, and fed others without storing it for the future."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""It is not permissible for any Muslim who has something to will to stay for two nights without having his last will and testament written and kept ready with him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Al-Harith:                     (The brother of the wife of Allah's Apostle. Juwaira bint Al-Harith) When Allah's Apostle died, he did not leave any Dirham or Dinar (i.e. money), a slave or a slave woman or anything else except his white mule, his arms and a piece of land which he had given in charity ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Talha bin Musarrif:                     I asked `Abdullah bin Abu `Aufa ""Did the Prophet make a will?"" He replied, ""No,"" I asked him, ""How is it then that the making of a will has been enjoined on people, (or that they are ordered to make a will)?"" He replied, ""The Prophet bequeathed Allah's Book (i.e. Qur'an)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Aswad:                     In the presence of `Aisha some people mentioned that the Prophet had appointed `Ali by will as his successor. `Aisha said, ""When did he appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas:                     The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca, ('Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sa`d bin Khaula)."" I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! May I will all my property (in charity)?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Then may I will half of it?"" He said, ""No"". I said, ""One third?"" He said: ""Yes, one third, yet even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah's sake will be considered as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife's mouth. Allah may lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by you."" At that time Sa`d had only one daughter."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     I recommend that people reduce the proportion of what they bequeath by will to the fourth (of the whole legacy), for Allah's Apostle said, ""One-third, yet even one third is too much."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`d:                     I fell sick and the Prophet paid me a visit. I said to him, ""O Allah's Apostle! I invoke Allah that He may not let me expire in the land whence I migrated (i.e. Mecca)."" He said, ""May Allah give you health and let the people benefit by you."" I said, ""I want to will my property, and I have only one daughter and I want to will half of my property (to be given in charity)."" He said,"" Half is too much."" I said, ""Then I will one third."" He said, ""One-third, yet even one-third is too much."" (The narrator added, ""So the people started to will one third of their property and that was Permitted for them."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (the wife of the Prophet) `Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to his brother Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas saying, ""The son of the slave-girl of Zam`a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody."" So during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sa`d took the boy and said, ""This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me."" 'Abu bin Zam's got up and said, ""He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father's bed."" Then both of them came to Allah's Apostle and Sa`d said, ""O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me."" Then 'Abu bin Zam`a got up and said, ""This is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father."" Allah's Apostle said, ""O Abu bin Zam`a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)."" Then the Prophet said to his wife Sauda bint Zam`a, ""Screen yourself from this boy,"" when he saw the boy's resemblance to `Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones. She was asked, ""Who has done so to you, soand- so? So-and-so?"" Till the name of the Jew was mentioned, whereupon she nodded (in agreement). So the Jew was brought and was questioned till he confessed. The Prophet then ordered that his head be crushed with stones."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The custom (in old days) was that the property of the deceased would be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), they would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled from that custom whatever He wished and fixed for the male double the amount inherited by the female, and for each parent a sixth (of the whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the husband a half or a fourth."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man asked the Prophet, ""O Allah's Apostle! What kind of charity is the best?"" He replied. ""To give in charity when you are healthy and greedy hoping to be wealthy and afraid of becoming poor. Don't delay giving in charity till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, 'Give so much to soand- so and so much to so-and so,' and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks he tells a lie; whenever he is entrusted he proves dishonest; whenever he promises he breaks his promise."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Urwa bin Az-Zubair:                     Hakim bin Hizam said, ""I asked Allah's Apostle for something, and he gave me, and I asked him again and he gave me and said, 'O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting as fruits), and whoever takes it without greed then he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it and he is like one who eats and never gets satisfied. The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking) hand."" Hakim added, ""I said, O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you till I die."" Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something but he refused to accept anything from him. Then `Umar called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then `Umar said, ""O Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it."" Thus Hakim did not ask anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he died--may Allah bestow His mercy upon him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""All of you are guardians and responsible for your charges: the Ruler (i.e. Imam) is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; and a man is a guardian of his family and is responsible for his charges; and a lady is a guardian in the house of her husband and is responsible for her charge; and a servant is a guardian of the property of his master and is responsible for his charge."" I think he also said, ""And a man is a guardian of the property of his father."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet said to Abu Talha, ""I recommend that you divide (this garden) amongst your relatives."" Abu Talha said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I will do the same."" So Abu Talha divided it among his relatives and cousins. Ibn 'Abbes said, ""When the Qur'anic Verse: ""Warn your nearest kinsmen."" (26.214) Was revealed, the Prophet started calling the various big families of Quraish, ""O Bani Fihr! O Bani Adi!"". Abu Huraira said, ""When the Verse: ""Warn your nearest kinsmen"" was revealed, the Prophet said (in a loud voice), ""O people of Quraish!"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     When Allah revealed the Verse: ""Warn your nearest kinsmen,"" Allah's Apostle got up and said, ""O people of Quraish (or said similar words)! Buy (i.e. save) yourselves (from the Hellfire) as I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Bani `Abd Manaf! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment, O Safiya, the Aunt of Allah's Apostle! I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muhammad! Ask me anything from my wealth, but I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet saw a man driving a Badana (i.e. camel for sacrifice) and said to him, ""Ride on it."" The man said, ""O Allah's Apostle! It is a Bandana."" (The Prophet repeated his order) and on the third or fourth time he said, ""Ride it, (woe to you"" or said: ""May Allah be merciful to you)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle saw a man driving a Badana and said to him, ""Ride on it,"" and on the second or the third time he added, ""Woe to you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The mother of Sa`d bin 'Ubada died in his absence. He said, ""O Allah's Apostle! My mother died in my absence; will it be of any benefit for her if I give Sadaqa on her behalf?"" The Prophet said, ""Yes,"" Sa`d said, ""I make you a witness that I gave my garden called Al Makhraf in charity on her behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ka`b bin Malik:                     I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! For the acceptance of my repentance I wish to give all my property in charity for Allah's sake through His Apostle ."" He said, ""It is better for you to keep some of the property for yourself."" I said, ""Then I will keep my share in Khaibar."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas (ra):                      When the Holy Verse: 'By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, it means here Allah's Reward i.e., Paradise), unless you spend of that which you love..', (V 3:92) was revealed, Abu Talha went to Allah's Messenger () and said, ""O Allah's Messenger ! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior stated in His book: 'By no means shall you attain Birr, unless you spend of that which you love....' (V 3:92) and the most beloved property to me is Bairuha' (which was a garden where Allah's Messenger () used to go to sit in its shade and drink from its water). I gave it to the Allah and His Messenger () hoping for Allah's Reward in the Hereafter. So, Ao Allah's Messenger ! Use it as Allah orders you to use it."" Allah's Messenger () said, ""Bravo! O Abu Talha, it is fruitful property. We have accepted it from you and now we return it to you. Distribute it amongst you relatives."" So, Abu Talha distributed it amongst his relatives, amongst whom were Ubai and Hassan. When Hassan sold his share of that garden to Mu'awiyya, he was asked, ""How do you see Abu Talha's Sadaqa?"" He replied, ""Who should not I sell a Sa' of date for Sa' of money ?"" The garden was situated on the courtyard of the palace of Bani Jadila built by Mu'awiya."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Some people claim that the order in the above Verse is cancelled, by Allah, it is not cancelled, but the people have stopped acting on it. There are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the inheritance): One is that who inherits; such a person should give (of what he inherits to the relatives, the orphans and the needy, etc.), the other is that who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the orphans): such a person should speak kindly and say (to those who are present at the time of distribution), ""I can not give it to you (as the wealth belongs to the orphans)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     A man said to the Prophet, ""My mother died suddenly, and I think that if she could speak, she would have given in charity. May I give in charity on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes! Give in charity on her behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Sa`d bin Ubada consulted Allah's Apostle saying, ""My mother died and she had an unfulfilled vow."" The Prophet said, ""Fulfill it on her behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     That the mother of Sa`d bin Ubada the brother of Bani Saida died in Sa`d's absence, so he came to the Prophet saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! My mother died in my absence, will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?"" The Prophet said, ""Yes."" Sa`d said, ""I take you as my witness that I give my garden Al-Makhraf in charity on her behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zuhri:                     `Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked `Aisha about the meaning of the Qur'anic Verse:-- ""And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice."" (4.2-3) Aisha said, ""It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:-- ""They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them..."" (4.127) and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     In the lifetime of Allah's Apostle , `Umar gave in charity some of his property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. `Umar said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity."" The Prophet; said, ""Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity."" So `Umar gave it in charity, and it was for Allah's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no intention of becoming wealthy by its means."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     The following Verse:-- ""If a guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration (i.e. wages), but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable."" (4.6) was revealed in connection with the guardian of an orphan, and it means that if he is poor he can have for himself (from the orphan's wealth) what is just and reasonable according to the orphan's share of the inheritance."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Avoid the seven great destructive sins."" The people enquire, ""O Allah's Apostle! What are they? ""He said, ""To join others in worship along with Allah, to practice sorcery, to kill the life which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause, (according to Islamic law), to eat up Riba (usury), to eat up an orphan's wealth, to give back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of fighting, and to accuse, chaste women, who never even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers."
Sarah,30," Nafi' said:                      ""Ibn 'Umar never refused to be appointed as guardian."" The most beloved thing to Ibn Sirin concerning an orphan's wealth was that the orphan's advisor and guardians would assemble to decide what is best for him. When Tawus was asked about something concerning an orphan's affairs, he would recite: '...And Allah knows him who means mischief from him who means good...' (V 2:220). 'Ata said concerning some orphans, ""The guardian is to provide for the young and the old orphans according to their needs from their shares."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     When Allah's Apostle came to Medina; he did not have any servant. Abu Talha (Anas' step-father) took me to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Anas is a wise boy, so let him serve you."" So, I served him at home and on journeys. If I did anything, he never asked me why I did it, and if I refrained from doing anything, he never asked me why I refrained from doing it."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Abu Talha had the greatest wealth of date-palms amongst the Ansar in Medina, and he prized above all his wealth (his garden) Bairuha', which was situated opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet ). The Prophet used to enter It and drink from its fresh water. When the following Divine Verse came:-- ""By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of what you love,"" (3.92) Abu Talha got up saying. ""O Allah's Apostle! Allah says, 'You will not attain piety until you spend of what you love,' and I prize above al I my wealth, Bairuha' which I want to give in charity for Allah's Sake, hoping for its reward from Allah. So you can use it as Allah directs you."" On that the Prophet said, ""Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives."" On that Abu Talha said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I will do (as you have suggested)."" So, Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     A man said to Allah's Apostle , ""My mother died, will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?"" The Prophet replied in the affirmative. The man said, ""I have a garden and I make you a witness that I give it in charity on her behalf."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     When the Prophet ordered that the mosque be built, he said, ""O Bani An-Najjar! Suggest to me a price for this garden of yours."" They replied, ""By Allah! We will demand its price from none but Allah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     When `Umar got a piece of land in Khaibar, he came to the Prophet saying, ""I have got a piece of land, better than which I have never got. So what do you advise me regarding it?"" The Prophet said, ""If you wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable purposes."" So, `Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be wealthy by its means."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     `Umar got some property in Khaibar and he came to the Prophet and informed him about it. The Prophet said to him, ""If you wish you can give it in charity."" So `Umar gave it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) the yield of which was to be used for the good of the poor, the needy, the kinsmen and the guests."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     When Allah's Apostle came to Medina, he ordered that a mosque be built. He said, ""O Bani An- Najjar! Suggest me a price for the garden of yours."" They replied, ""By Allah, we will not ask its price except from Allah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     Once `Umar gave a horse in charity to be used in holy fighting. It had been given to him by Allah's Apostle . `Umar gave it to another man to ride. Then `Umar was informed that the man put the horse for sale, so he asked Allah's Apostle whether he could buy it. Allah's Apostle replied, ""You should not buy it, for you should not take back what you have given in charity."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""My heirs will not inherit a Dinar or a Dirham (i.e. money), for whatever I leave (excluding the adequate support of my wives and the wages of my employees) is given in charity."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     When `Umar founded an endowment he stipulated that its administrator could eat from it and also feed his friend on the condition that he would not store anything for himself from it.
Sarah,30," Abu 'Abdur-Rahman narrated:                      When 'Uthman (ra) was circled (by the rebels), he looked upon them from above and said, ""Ias you by Allah, I ask nobody but the Companions of the Prophet (), dont you know that Allah's Messenger () said, 'Whoever  will (buy and) dig the well of Ruma will be granted Paradise,' and I (bought and) dug it? Don't you know that he said. 'Whoever equip the army of 'Usra (i.e., Tabuk's Ghazwa) will be granted Paradise,' and I equipped it ?"" They attested whatever he said.When 'Umar founded his endowment he said, ""Its administrator can eat from it."" The management of the endowment can be taken over by the founder himself or any other person, for both cases are permissible."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet said (at the time of building the Mosque), ""O Ban, An-Najjar! Suggest to me a price for your garden."" They replied, ""We do not ask its price except from Allah."""
Sarah,30," Ibn 'Abbas (ra) said, ""A man from the tribe of Bani Sahm went out in the company of Tamim Ad-Dari and 'Adi bin Badda'. The man of Bani Sahm died in a land where there was no Muslim. When Tamim and 'Adi returned conveying the property of the deceased, they claimed that they had lost a silver bowl with gold engraving. Allah's Messenger () made them take an oath (to confirm their claim), and then the bowl was found in Makkah with some people who claimed that they had bought it from Tamim and 'Adu, Then two witnesses from the relatives of the deceased got up and swore that their witnesses were more valid than the witnesses of  'Adi and Tamim, and that the bowl belonged to their deceased fellow. So, this verse was revealed in connection with this case ; 'O you who believe! When death approached any of you ...',"" (V 5:                     106)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah Al-Ansari:                     My father was martyred on the day (of the Ghazwa) of Uhud and left six daughters and some debts to be paid. When the time of plucking the date-fruits came, I went to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! you know that my father was martyred on Uhud's day and owed much debt, and I wish that the creditors would see you."" The Prophet said, ""Go and collect the various kinds of dates and place them separately in heaps""' I did accordingly and called him. On seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over it and said, ""Call your companions (i.e. the creditors)."" Then he kept on measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father's debts. By Allah, it would have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and I looked at the heap where Allah's Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date had been taken thereof."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Masud:                     I asked Allah's Apostle, ""O Allah's Apostle! What is the best deed?"" He replied, ""To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times."" I asked, ""What is next in goodness?"" He replied, ""To be good and dutiful to your parents."" I further asked, what is next in goodness?"" He replied, ""To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause."" I did not ask Allah's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""There is no Hijra (i.e. migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth immediately."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     (That she said), ""O Allah's Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed. Should we not fight in Allah's Cause?"" He said, ""The best Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet's tradition and is accepted by Allah)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward)."" He replied, ""I do not find such a deed."" Then he added, ""Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break your fast?"" The man said, ""But who can do that?"" Abu- Huraira added, ""The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Somebody asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! Who is the best among the people?"" Allah's Apostle replied ""A believer who strives his utmost in Allah's Cause with his life and property."" They asked, ""Who is next?"" He replied, ""A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Allah and leaving the people secure from his mischief."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""The example of a Mujahid in Allah's Cause-- and Allah knows better who really strives in His Cause----is like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Allah guarantees that He will admit the Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his home safely with rewards and war booty."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah's Apostle, once visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah's Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, ""What causes you to smile, O Allah's Apostle?"" He said. ""Some of my followers who (in a dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah's Cause (on board a ship) amidst this sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the thrones)."" (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet used.) Um-Haram said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them. Allah's Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um Haram asked, ""What makes you smile, O Allah's Apostle?"" He replied, ""Some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah's Cause,"" repeating the same dream. Um-Haram said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of them."" He said, ""You are amongst the first ones."" It happened that she sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu'awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever believes in Allah and His Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah's Cause or remains in the land where he is born."" The people said, ""O Allah's Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the people with the is good news?"" He said, ""Paradise has one-hundred grades which Allah has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of Paradise."" (i.e. The sub-narrator added, ""I think the Prophet also said, 'Above it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the rivers of Paradise."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Samura:                     The Prophet said, ""Last night two men came to me (in a dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house, better of which I have never seen. One of them said, 'This house is the house of martyrs."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet said, ""A single endeavor (of fighting) in Allah's Cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is in it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""A place in Paradise as small as a bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world)."" He also said, ""A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     The Prophet said, ""A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Anas bin Malik:                          The Prophet said, ""Nobody who dies and finds good from Allah (in the      Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given     the whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on      seeing the superiority of martyrdom, would like to come back to the      world and get killed again (in Allah's Cause)."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Anas:                      The Prophet said, ""A single endeavor (of fighting) in      Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all      the world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the      bow or lash of one of you is better than all the world and whatever is     in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the      earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with      light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world      and whatever is in it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya' (army-unit) setting out in Allah's Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Allah's Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get martyred."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, ""Zaid took the flag and was martyred, and then Ja`far took the flag and was martyred, and then `Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and Allah made him victorious."" The Prophet further added, ""It would not please us to have them with us."" Aiyub, a sub-narrator, added, ""Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, 'It would not please them to be with us.'"""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Um Haram said, ""Once the Prophet slept in my house near to me and got up smiling. I said, 'What makes you smile?' He replied, 'Some of my followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings on thrones.' I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them."" So the Prophet invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said, ""Invoke Allah to make me one of them."" He said, ""You are among the first batch."" Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband 'Ubada bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus she died."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them, ""I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Allah's Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me."" So he went ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal uncle said, ""Allah is Greater! By the Lord of the Ka`ba, I am successful."" After that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, ""I think another man was saved along with him)."" Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite, ""Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made us pleased "" Later on this Qur'anic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Allah for forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jundab bin Sufyan:                     In one of the holy Battles a finger of Allah's Apostle (got wounded and) bled. He said, ""You are just a finger that bled, and what you got is in Allah's Cause."""

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him, ""I asked you about the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you told me that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are tested in this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs."
Sarah,30," Narrated Kharija bin Zaid:                     Zaid bin Thabit said, ""When the Qur'an was compiled from various written manuscripts, one of the Verses of Surat Al-Ahzab was missing which I used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting. I could not find it except with Khuza`ima bin Thabjt Al-Ansari, whose witness Allah's Apostle regarded as equal to the witness of two men. And the Verse was:-- ""Among the believers are men who have been true to what they covenanted with Allah."" (33.23)"

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     A man came to the Prophet and asked, ""A man fights for war booty; another fights for fame and a third fights for showing off; which of them fights in Allah's Cause?""

When he saw them, he came up to them and sat down with his legs drawn up and wrapped in his garment and said, ""(During the construction of the mosque of the Prophet) we carried the adobe of the mosque, one brick at a time while `Ammar used to carry two at a time. The Prophet passed by `Ammar and removed the dust off his head and said, ""May Allah be merciful to `Ammar.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     When Allah's Apostle returned on the day (of the battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench), he put down his arms and took a bath. Then Gabriel whose head was covered with dust, came to him saying, ""You have put down your arms! By Allah, I have not put down my arms yet."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Where (to go now)?"" Gabriel said, ""This way,"" pointing towards the tribe of Bani Quraiza. So Allah's Apostle went out towards them ."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     For thirty days Allah's Apostle invoked Allah to curse those who had killed the companions of Bir- Mauna; he invoked evil upon the tribes of Ral, Dhakwan, and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle.

Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir:                     My father's mutilated body was brought to the Prophet and was placed in front of him. I went to uncover his face but my companions forbade me. Then mourning cries of a lady were heard, and it was said that she was either the daughter or the sister of `Amr. The Prophet said, ""Why is she crying?"" Or said, ""Do not cry, for the angels are still shading him with their wings."" (Al-Bukhari asked Sadqa, a sub-narrator, ""Does the narration include the expression: 'Till he was lifted?' "" The latter replied, ""Jabir may have said it."")"
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Anas bin Malik:                          The Prophet said, ""Nobody who enters Paradise likes to go back to the      world even if he got everything on the earth, except a Mujahid who      wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times      because of the dignity he receives (from Allah)."""

Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          Allah's Apostle said, ""Once Solomon, son of David said, '(By Allah)      Tonight I will have sexual intercourse with one hundred (or      ninety-nine) women each of whom will give birth to a knight who will      fight in Allah's Cause.' On that a (i.e. if Allah wills) but he did      not say, 'Allah willing.' Therefore only one of those women conceived      and gave birth to a half-man.

The Prophet stopped and said, ""Give me my cloak. If I had as many camels as these thorny trees, I would have distributed them amongst you and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a coward."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:                     Sa`d used to teach his sons the following words as a teacher teaches his students the skill of writing and used to say that Allah's Apostle used to seek Refuge with Allah from them (i.e. the evils) at the end of every prayer. The words are: 'O Allah! I seek refuge with You from cowardice, and seek refuge with You from being brought back to a bad stage of old life and seek refuge with You from the afflictions of the world, and seek refuge with You from the punishments in the grave.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet used to say, ""O Allah! I seek refuge with You from helplessness, laziness, cowardice and feeble old age; I seek refuge with You from afflictions of life and death and seek refuge with You from the punishment in the grave."""

One fights in      Allah's Cause and gets killed. Later on Allah forgives the 'killer who     also get martyred (In Allah's Cause)."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Abu Huraira:                          I went to Allah's Apostle while he was at Khaibar after it had fallen      in the Muslims' hands. I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Give me a share      (from the land of Khaibar).""     One of the sons of Sa'id bin Al-'As said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Do not      give him a share."" I said, ""This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal."" The      son of Said bin Al-As said, ""Strange! A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has     come down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of      sheep) blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by      Allah because of me, and Allah did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e.      was not killed as an infidel).""

Ibn Um-Maktum complained about his blindness and on that the following revelation came: ""Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive hard and fight in the Way of Allah with their wealth and lives)."" (4.95)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi:                     I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the Mosque. So I came forward and sat by his side. He told us that Zaid bin Thabit had told him that Allah's Apostle had dictated to him the Divine Verse: ""Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and lives.' (4.95) Zaid said, ""Ibn-Maktum came to the Prophet while he was dictating to me that very Verse. On that Ibn Um Maktum said, ""O Allah's Apostle! If I had power, I would surely take part in Jihad."" He was a blind man. So Allah sent down revelation to His Apostle while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me that I feared that my thigh would be broken. Then that state of the Prophet was over after Allah revealed ""...except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) (4.95)"

When he noticed their fatigue and hunger he said, ""O Allah! The real life is that of the Here-after, (so please) forgive the Ansar and the Emigrants."" In its reply the Emigrants and the Ansar said, ""We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to Muhammad that we will carry on Jihad as long as we live."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The Emigrants and the Ansar started digging the trench around Medina carrying the earth on their backs and saying, ""We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to Muhammad that we will I carry on Jihad as long as we live."" The Prophet kept on replying, ""O Allah, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter; so confer Your Blessings on the Ansar and the Emigrants."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     On the day (of the battle) of Al-Ahzab (i.e. clans) I saw the Prophet carrying earth, and the earth was covering the whiteness of his `Abdomen. And he was saying, ""Without You (O Allah!) we would have got no guidance, nor given in charity, nor prayed. So please bless us with tranquility and make firm our feet when we meet our enemies. Indeed (these) people have rebelled against (oppressed) us but never shall we yield if they try to bring affliction upon us."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Anas:                     We returned from the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with the Prophet. (See Hadith No. 92 below) .
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     While the Prophet was in a Ghazwa he said, ""Some people have remained behind us in Medina and we never crossed a mountain path or a valley, but they were with us (i.e. sharing the reward with us), as they have been held back by a (legal) excuse. """
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id:                     I heard the Prophet saying, ""Indeed, anyone who fasts for one day for Allah's Pleasure, Allah will keep his face away from the (Hell) fire for (a distance covered by a journey of) seventy years."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Whoever spends two things in Allah's Cause, will be called by all the gate-keepers of Paradise who will be saying, 'O so-and-so! Come here.' "" Abu Bakr said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Such persons will never be destroyed."" The Prophet said, ""I hope you will be one of them."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     Allah's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, ""Nothing worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly blessings which will be conferred on you."" Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures. He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A man got up saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?"" The Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked, ""Where is the present questioner?"" ""Do you think wealth is good?"" he repeated thrice, adding, ""No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent in Allah's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:                     Allah's Apostle said, "" He who pre pares a Ghazi going in Allah's Cause is given a reward equal to that of) a Ghazi; and he who looks after properly the dependents of a Ghazi going in Allah's Cause is (given a reward equal to that of) Ghazi."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Aun:                     Once Musa bin Anas while describing the battle of Yamama, said, ""Anas bin Malik went to Thabit bin Qais, who had lifted his clothes from his thighs and was applying Hunut to his body. Anas asked, 'O Uncle! What is holding you back (from the battle)?' He replied, 'O my nephew! I am coming just now,' and went on perfuming himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people fled from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, 'Clear the way for me to fight the enemy. We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Allah's Apostle. How bad the habits you have acquired from your enemies!"""

The Prophet said again, ""Who will bring me the information about the enemy?"" Az-Zubair said again, ""I will."" The Prophet said, ""Every prophet had a disciple and my disciple is Az-Zubair. """

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:                     (from his father) Abu Qatada went out (on a journey) with Allah's Apostle but he was left behind with some of his companions who were in the state of Ihram. He himself was not in the state of Ihram. They saw an opener before he could see it. When they saw the opener, they did not speak anything till Abu Qatada saw it. So, he rode over his horse called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and slaughtered it. He ate of its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating. When they met the Prophet (they asked him about it) and he asked, ""Have you some of its meat (left) with you?"" Abu Qatada replied, ""Yes, we have its leg with us."" So, the Prophet took and ate it."
Sarah,30, Narrated Sahl:                     In our garden there was a horse belonging to the Prophet called Al-Luhaif or Al-Lakhif.
Sarah,30," Narrated Mu`adh:                     I was a companion rider of the Prophet on a donkey called 'Ufair. The Prophet asked, ""O Mu`adh! Do you know what Allah's right on His slaves is, and what the right of His slaves on Him is?"" I replied, ""Allah and His Apostle know better."" He said, ""Allah's right on His slaves is that they should worship Him (Alone) and should not worship any besides Him. And slave's right on Allah is that He should not punish him who worships none besides Him."" I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Should I not inform the people of this good news?"" He said, ""Do not inform them of it, lest they should depend on it (absolutely)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Once there was a feeling of fright in Medina, so the Prophet borrowed a horse belonging to us called Mandub (and he rode away on it).

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle said, "" Horses are kept for one of three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Allah's Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Allah's Apostle was asked about donkeys, he replied, ""Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this unique, comprehensive Verse: ""Then anyone who does an atom's (or a small ant's) weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom's (or a small ant's) weight of evil, shall see it.'

He said, ""I accompanied him on one of the journeys."" (Abu `Aqil said, ""I do not know whether that journey was for the purpose of Jihad or `Umra."") ""When we were returning,"" Jabir continued, ""the Prophet said, 'Whoever wants to return earlier to his family, should hurry up.' We set off and I was on a black red tainted camel having no defect, and the people were behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, 'O Jabir, wait!' Then he hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, 'Will you sell the camel?' I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, 'This is your camel.' He came out and started examining the camel and saying, 'The camel is ours.' Then the Prophet sent some Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, 'Give it to Jabir.' Then he asked, 'Have you taken the full price (of the camel)?' I replied in the affirmative. He said, 'Both the price and the camel are for you.' ''"

When the Muslims started collecting the war booty, the pagans faced us with arrows, but Allah's Apostle did not flee. No doubt, I saw him on his white mule and Abu Sufyan was holding its reins and the Prophet was saying, 'I am the Prophet in truth: I am the son of `Abdul Muttalib.' """

Let such a      person perish and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him      not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds      the reins of his horse to strive in Allah's Cause, with his hair      unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the      vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if      he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post with      satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for      permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession     is not accepted."""

I make the area which is in between Medina's two mountains a sanctuary, as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless us in our Sa and Mudd (i.e. units of measuring)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     We were with the Prophet (on a journey) and the only shade one could have was the shade made by one's own garment. Those who fasted did not do any work and those who did not fast served the camels and brought the water on them and treated the sick and (wounded). So, the Prophet said, ""Today, those who were not fasting took (all) the reward."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a human being. If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding animal by helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, all this will be regarded charity. A good word, and every step one takes to offer the compulsory Congregational prayer, is regarded as charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa'di:                     Allah's Apostle said, ""To guard Muslims from infidels in Allah's Cause for one day is better than the world and whatever is on its surface, and a place in Paradise as small as that occupied by the whip of one of you is better than the world and whatever is on its surface; and a morning's or an evening's journey which a slave (person) travels in Allah's Cause is better than the world and whatever is on its surface."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     The Prophet said to Abu Talha, ""Choose one of your boy servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.""

I seek refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men."" Then we reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. So Allah's Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him till we reached a place called Sa`d-AsSahba,' where her menses were over and he took her for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah's Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of Allah's Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah's Apostle folding a cloak round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him) He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and said, ""This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us."" Then he looked at Medina and said, ""O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Um Haram told me that the Prophet one day took a midday nap in her house. Then he woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, ""O Allah's Apostle!

Invoke Allah to make me one of them."" He replied, ""You are amongst them."" He slept again and then woke up smiling and said the same as before twice or thrice. And she said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them."" And he said, ""You are amongst the first batch."" 'Ubada bin As-Samit married her (i.e. Um Haram) and then he took her for Jihad. When she returned, an animal was presented to her to ride, but she fell down and her neck was broken."
Sarah,30," Narrated Mus`ab bin Sa`d:                     Once Sa`d (bin Abi Waqqas) thought that he was superior to those who were below him in rank. On that the Prophet said, ""You gain no victory or livelihood except through (the blessings and invocations of) the poor amongst you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     The Prophet said, ""A time will come when groups of people will go for Jihad and it will be asked, 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the Prophet?' The answer will be, 'Yes.' Then they will be given victory (by Allah) (because of him). Then a time will come when it will be asked. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the companions of the Prophet?' It will be said, 'Yes,' and they will be given victory (by Allah). Then a time will come when it will be said. 'Is there anyone amongst you who has enjoyed the company of the companions of the companions of the Prophet?'

Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi:                     Allah's Apostle and the pagans faced each other and started fighting. When Allah's Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned to their camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of Allah's Apostle who would follow and kill with his sword any pagan going alone. He said, ""Nobody did his job (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Indeed, he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire."" A man amongst the people said, ""I shall accompany him (to watch what he does)"" Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the sword and killed himself. The other man came to Allah's Apostle and said, ""I testify that you are Allah's Apostle."" The Prophet asked, ""What has happened?"" He replied, ""(It is about) the man whom you had described as one of the people of the (Hell) Fire. The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, 'I will find out his reality for you.' So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed himself."" when Allah's Apostle said, ""A man may seem to the people as if he were practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa`:                     The Prophet passed by some people of the tribe of Bani Aslam who were practicing archery. The Prophet said, ""O Bani Isma`il ! Practice archery as your father Isma`il was a great archer. Keep on throwing arrows and I am with Bani so-and-so."" So one of the parties ceased throwing. Allah's Apostle said, ""Why do you not throw?"" They replied, ""How should we throw while you are with them (i.e. on their side)?"" On that the Prophet said, ""Throw, and I am with all of you."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Abu Talha and the Prophet used to shield themselves with one shield. Abu Talha was a good archer, and when he threw (his arrows) the Prophet would look at the target of his arrows."

But when she saw that the bleeding increased more by the water, she took a mat, burnt it, and placed the ashes on the wound of the Prophet and so the blood stopped oozing out."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Umar:                     The properties of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had transferred to His Apostle as Fai Booty were not gained by the Muslims with their horses and camels.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Ali:                     I never saw the Prophet saying, ""Let my parents sacrifice their lives for you,"" to any man after Sa`d. I heard him saying (to him), ""Throw (the arrows)! Let my parents sacrifice their lives for you."""
Sarah,30," Narrated `Aisha:                     Allah's Apostle came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Bu'ath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet reclined on the bed and turned his face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me and said protestingly, ""Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah's Apostle?"" Allah's Apostle turned his face towards him and said, ""Leave them."" When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I waved the two girls to go away and they left. It was the day of `Id when negroes used to play with leather shields and spears. Either I requested Allah's Apostle or he himself asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then he let me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, ""Carry on, O Bani Arfida (i.e. negroes)!"" When I got tired, he asked me if that was enough. I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave."
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     The 'Prophet was the best and the bravest amongst the people. Once the people of Medina got terrified at night, so they went in the direction of the noise (that terrified them). The Prophet met them (on his way back) after he had found out the truth. He was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and a sword was hanging by his neck, and he was saying, ""Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!""

The latter were in a state of Ihram, while he was not. He saw an onager and rode his horse and requested his companions to give him his lash but they refused. Then he asked them to give him his spear but they refused, so he took it himself, attacked the onager, and killed it. Some of the companions of the Prophet ate of it while some others refused to eat.

Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet said, ""The example of a miser and the one who gives in charity, is like the example of two men wearing iron cloaks so tightly that their arms are raised forcibly towards their collar-bones. So, whenever a charitable person wants to give in charity, his cloak spreads over his body so much so that it wipes out his traces, but whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his hands gets connected to his collarbones.

So the Muslims retreated towards the Prophet while he was riding his white mule which was being led by his cousin Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin `Abdul Muttalib.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle sent his letter to Khusrau and ordered his messenger to hand it over to the Governor of Bahrain who was to hand it over to Khusrau.

Sarah,30," Narrated `Abdullah bin `Abbas:                     Allah's Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah's Apostle ordered to hand it over to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah's Apostle reached Caesar, he said after reading it, 'Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about Allah's Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been concluded between Allah's Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said, Caesar's messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar's court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator. 'Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a prophet."" Abu Sufyan added, ""I replied, 'I am the nearest relative to him.' He asked, 'What degree of relationship do you have with him?' I replied, 'He is my cousin,' and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, 'Let him come nearer.' He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his translator, 'Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his translator, 'Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.' I replied, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.' He said, 'Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before him? 'I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he claimed? ' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I replied, 'No.' He said, ""Do the noble or the poor follow him?' I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are they increasing or decreasing (day by day)?' I replied,' They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his (the Prophet's) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?'. I replied, 'No. ' He said, 'Does he break his promises? I replied, 'No, but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us."" Abu Sufyan added, ""Other than the last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'What was the outcome of your battles with him?' I replied, 'The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.' When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' "" Abu Sufyan added, ""Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah's Apostle and it was read. Its contents were: ""In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe; embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) Abu Sufyan added, ""When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him, and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them, 'Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha's (i.e. the Prophet's) affair has gained power. This is the King of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah, I remained low and was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I disliked it."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sahl bin Sa`d:                     That he heard the Prophet on the day (of the battle) of Khaibar saying, ""I will give the flag to a person at whose hands Allah will grant victory."" So, the companions of the Prophet got up, wishing eagerly to see to whom the flag will be given, and everyone of them wished to be given the flag. But the Prophet asked for `Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he ordered them to bring `Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. `Ali said, ""We will fight with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims)."" The Prophet said, ""Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle attacked some people, he would never attack them till it was dawn.

So, when the day dawned, the Jews came out with their bags and spades. When they saw the Prophet; they said, ""Muhammad and his army!"" The Prophet said, Allahu--Akbar! (Allah is Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned."""

Sarah,30," Narrated Ka`b bin Malik:                     Whenever Allah's Apostle intended to carry out a Ghazwa, he would use an equivocation to conceal his real destination till it was the Ghazwa of Tabuk which Allah's Apostle carried out in very hot weather. As he was going to face a very long journey through a wasteland and was to meet and attack a large number of enemies. So, he made the situation clear to the Muslims so that they might prepare themselves accordingly and get ready to conquer their enemy. The Prophet informed them of the destination he was heading for."

The Prophet asked me, ""What is wrong with the camel?"" I replied, ""It has got tired."" So. Allah's Apostle came from behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and going ahead of them. Then he asked me, ""How do you find your camel (now)?"" I replied, ""I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings."" He said, ""Will you sell it to me?"" I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Sell it to me then."" I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I am a bridegroom,"" and requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah's Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had married a matron. He said, ""Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and you would have played with her?"" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! My father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them.

He said, ""What will sustain you after your camels (are finished)?"" Then `Umar went to the Prophet and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! What will sustain them after their camels (are finished)?"" Allah's Apostle said, ""Make an announcement amongst the people that they should bring all their remaining food (to me)."" (They brought it and) the Prophet invoked Allah and asked for His Blessings for it. Then he asked them to bring their food utensils and the people started filling their food utensils with their hands till they were satisfied.

Then Allah's Apostle said, ""O Hatib! What is this?"" Hatib replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! Don't hasten to give your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief) to Islam."" Allah's Apostle, said, ""Hatib has told you the truth."" `Umar said, O Allah's Apostle!

So, the people wondered all that night as to who would receive the flag and in the morning everyone hoped that he would be that person. Allah's Apostle asked, ""Where is `Ali?"" He was told that `Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The Prophet gave him the flag. `Ali said, ""Should I fight them till they become like us (i.e. Muslim)?"" The Prophet said, ""Go to them patiently and calmly till you enter the land.

So they went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) till they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina).

Make him firm and make him a guiding and rightly guided man.' "" Jarir proceeded towards that house, and dismantled and burnt it. Then he sent a messenger to Allah's Apostle informing him of that. Jarir's messenger said, ""By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till I had left it like an emancipated or gabby camel (i.e. completely marred and spoilt)."" Jarir added, ""The Prophet asked for Allah's Blessings for the horses and the men of Ahmas five times."""

I asked him, 'What has happened to you?' He said, 'I don't know who came to me and hit me.' Then I drove my sword into his belly and pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot. I came to my companions and said, 'I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.' So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi`, the merchant pf Hijaz.

When Allah's Messenger () entered the garden of date-palms, he started hiding himself behind the trunks of the palms while Ibn Saiyyad was covered with a velvet sheet with murmurs emanating from under it. Ibn Saiyyah's mother saw Allah's Messenger () and said, ""O Saf! This is Muhammad."" So Ibn Saiyyad got up. Allah's Messenger () said, ""If she had left him (in his state), the truth would have been clear."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara:                     I saw Allah's Apostle on the day (of the battle) of the Trench carrying earth till the hair of his chest were covered with dust and he was a hairy man. He was reciting the following verses of `Abdullah (bin Rawaha): ""O Allah, were it not for You, We would not have been guided, Nor would we have given in charity, nor prayed. So, bestow on us calmness, and when we meet the enemy. Then make our feet firm, for indeed, Yet if they want to put us in affliction, (i.e. want to fight against us) we would not (flee but withstand them)."" The Prophet used to raise his voice while reciting these verses. (See Hadith No. 432, Vol. 5)."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jarir:                     Allah's Apostle did not screen himself from me since my embracing Islam, and whenever he saw me he would receive me with a smile. Once I told him that I could not sit firm on horses. He stroke me on the chest with his hand and said, ""O Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and a rightly guided man."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Hazim:                     The people asked Sahl bin Sa`d As-Sa' idi ""With what thing (medicine) was the wound of Allah's Apostle treated?"" He replied, ""There is none left (living) amongst the people who knows it better than. `Ali used to bring water in his shield and Fatima (i.e. the Prophet's daughter) used to wash the blood off his face. Then a mat (of palm leaves) was burnt and its ash was inserted in the wound of Allah's Apostle."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Burda:                     That his father said, ""The Prophet sent Mu`adh and Abu Musa to Yemen telling them. 'Treat the people with ease and don't be hard on them; give them glad tidings and don't fill them with aversion; and love each other, and don't differ."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib:                     The Prophet appointed `Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He instructed them, ""Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you."" Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of `Abdullah bin Jubair said, ""The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?"" `Abdullah bin Jubair said, ""Have you forgotten what Allah's Apostle said to you?"" They replied, ""By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty."" But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Apostle in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, ""Is Muhammad present amongst these people?"" The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, ""Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?"" He asked again thrice, ""Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?"" He then returned to his companions and said, ""As for these (men), they have been killed."" `Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), ""You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there."" Abu Sufyan said, ""Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed"" After that he started reciting cheerfully, ""O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his companions), ""Why don't you answer him back?"" They said, ""O Allah's Apostle What shall we say?"" He said, ""Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime."" (Then) Abu Sufyan said, ""We have the (idol) Al `Uzza, and you have no `Uzza."" The Prophet said (to his companions), ""Why don't you answer him back?"" They asked, ""O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?"" He said, ""Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas:                     Allah's Apostle was the (most handsome), most generous and the bravest of all the people. Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an uproar at night. So, the Prophet met the people while he was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and carrying his sword (slung over his shoulder). He said (to them), ""Don't get scared, don't get scared."" Then he added, ""I found it (i.e the horse) very fast."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama:                     I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf met me. I said to him, ""Woe to you! What brought you here?"" He replied, ""The she-camels of the Prophet have been taken away."" I said, ""Who took them?"" He said, ""Ghatafan and Fazara."" So, I sent three cries, ""O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah !"" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them saying, ""I am the son of Al-Akwa`""; and today perish the mean people!"" So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, ""O Allah's Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so send some people to chase them."" The Prophet said, ""O son of Al-Akwa`, you have gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being entertained by their folk."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu 'Is-haq:                     A man asked Al-Bara ""O Abu '`Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the battle) of Hunain?"" Al-Bara replied while I was listening, ""As for Allah's Apostle he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al- Harith was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of `Abdul Muttalib.' On that day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri:                     When the tribe of Bani Quraiza was ready to accept Sa`d's judgment, Allah's Apostle sent for Sa`d who was near to him. Sa`d came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Allah's Apostle said (to the Ansar), ""Stand up for your leader."" Then Sa`d came and sat beside Allah's Apostle who said to him. ""These people are ready to accept your judgment."" Sa`d said, ""I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners."" The Prophet then remarked, ""O Sa`d! You have judged amongst them with (or similar to) the judgment of the King Allah."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik (ra):                      Allah's Messenger () entered (Makkah) in the year of the Conquest (of Makkah) wearing a helmet over his head. After he took it off, a man came and said, ""Ibn Khatal is clinging to the curtains of the Ka'bah."" The Prophet () said, ""Kill him."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Allah's Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the leadership of `Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of `Asim bin `Umar Al-Khattab. They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between 'Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, ""These are the dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), ""and continued following their tracks When `Asim and his companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them. The infidels said to them, ""Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill any one of you"" `Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya said, ""By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they martyred `Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the third (of the captives) said, ""This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us."" So, they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. Narrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, ""When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca."" The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, ""It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib."" When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two rak`at (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two rak`at and then said, ""Hadn't I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no exception."" (He then recited the poetic verse):-- ""I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah's Cause, For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body"" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-rak`at prayer (before being killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of `Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) `Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over `Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from his flesh."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Musa:                     The Prophet said, ""Free the captives, feed the hungry and pay a visit to the sick."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Juhaifa:                     I asked `Ali, ""Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration besides what is in Allah's Book?"" `Ali replied, ""No, by Him Who splits the grain of corn and creates the soul. I don't think we have such knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have what is written in this paper as well."" I asked, ""What is written in this paper?"" He replied, ""(The regulations of) blood-money, the freeing of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed for killing an infidel."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Some Ansari men asked permission from Allah's Apostle saying, ""O Allah's Apostle! Allow us not to take the ransom of our nephew Al `Abbas. The Prophet replied, ""Do not leave a single Dirham thereof."""
Sarah,30," (In another narration) Anas said:                      ""Some wealth was brought to the Prophet from Bahrain. Al `Abbas came to him and said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Give me (some of it), as I have paid my and `Aqil's ransom.' The Prophet said, 'Take,' and gave him in his garment."""
Sarah,30, Narrated Jubair:                     (who was among the captives of the Battle of Badr) I heard the Prophet reciting 'Surat-at-Tur' in the Maghrib prayer.
Sarah,30," Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa`:                     ""An infidel spy came to the Prophet while he was on a journey. The spy sat with the companions of the Prophet and started talking and then went away. The Prophet said (to his companions), 'Chase and kill him.' So, I killed him."" The Prophet then gave him the belongings of the killed spy (in addition to his share of the war booty)."
Sarah,30," Narrated `Amr bin Maimun:                     `Umar (after he was stabbed), instructed (his would-be-successor) saying, ""I urge him (i.e. the new Caliph) to take care of those non-Muslims who are under the protection of Allah and His Apostle in that he should observe the convention agreed upon with them, and fight on their behalf (to secure their safety) and he should not over-tax them beyond their capability."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     Ibn `Abbas said, ""Thursday! What (great thing) took place on Thursday!"" Then he started weeping till his tears wetted the gravels of the ground . Then he said, ""On Thursday the illness of Allah's Apostle was aggravated and he said, ""Fetch me writing materials so that I may have something written to you after which you will never go astray."" The people (present there) differed in this matter and people should not differ before a prophet. They said, ""Allah's Apostle is seriously sick.' The Prophet said, ""Let me alone, as the state in which I am now, is better than what you are calling me for."" The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, ""Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them."" I forgot the third (order)"" (Ya'qub bin Muhammad said, ""I asked Al-Mughira bin `Abdur-Rahman about the Arabian Peninsula and he said, 'It comprises Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and Yemen."" Ya'qub added, ""And Al-Arj, the beginning of Tihama."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     `Umar saw a silken cloak being sold in the market and he brought it to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Buy this cloak and adorn yourself with it on the `Id festivals and on meeting the delegations."" Allah's Apostle replied, ""This is the dress for the one who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter)."" After sometime had passed, Allah's Apostle sent a silken cloak to `Umar. `Umar took it and brought it to Allah's Apostle and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! You have said that this is the dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have sent me this!"" The Prophet said,"" I have sent it) so that you may sell it or fulfill with it some of your needs."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ibn 'Umar:                          Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet set out with the      Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the      hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his      puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet      stroked him on the back with his hand and said, ""Ibn Saiyad! Do you      testify that I am Allah's Apostle?"" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said,     ""I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates.""     Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. ""Do you testify that I am the      apostle of Allah?"" The Prophet said to him, ""I believe in Allah and      His Apostles."" Then the Prophet said (to Ibn Saiyad). ""What do you      see?"" Ibn Saiyad replied, ""True people and false ones visit me."" The      Prophet said, ""Your mind is confused as to this matter."" The Prophet      added, "" I have kept something (in my mind) for you."" Ibn Saiyad said,     ""It is Ad-Dukh."" The Prophet said (to him), ""Shame be on you! You      cannot cross your limits."" On that 'Umar said, ""O Allah's Apostle!      Allow me to chop his head off."" The Prophet said, ""If he should be him     (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be      him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."""
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Ibn Umar:                          (Later on) Allah's Apostle (once again) went along with Ubai bin Ka'b      to the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the      Prophet entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the      trunks of the date-palms as he wanted to hear something from the Ibn      Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his      bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard.      Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind     the trunks of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, ""O Saf!"" (And      this was his name). Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, ""Had this      woman let him to himself, he would have revealed the reality of his      case."" Then the Prophet got up amongst the people, glorifying Allah as     He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, ""I warn you about him      (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation      about him, and Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a      statement which no prophet informed his nation of. You should      understand that he is a one-eyed man and Allah is not one-eyed."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Usama bin Zaid:                     I asked the Prophet during his Hajj, ""O Allah's Apostle! Where will you stay tomorrow?"" He said, ""Has `Aqil left for us any house?"" He then added, ""Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab, where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of the is tribe or give them shelter."" (Az-Zuhri said, ""Khaif means valley."") (See Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2)"
Sarah,30," Narrated Aslam:                     `Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or other specified animals). He said to him, ""O Hunai! Don't oppress the Muslims and ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf and the livestock of (`Uthman) bin `Affan, for if their livestock should perish, then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and appeal for help saying, 'O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!' Would I then neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims' treasury). By Allah, these people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the prelslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah's Cause, I would not have turned even a span of their land into a Hima."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Hudhaifa:                     The Prophet said (to us), "" List the names of those people who have announced that they are Muslims."" So, we listed one thousand and five hundred men. Then we wondered, ""Should we be afraid (of infidels) although we are one thousand and five hundred in number?"" No doubt, we witnessed ourselves being afflicted with such bad trials that one would have to offer the prayer alone in fear."
Sarah,30," Narrated Al-A`mash:                     ""We (listed the Muslims and) found them five hundred."" And Abu Muawiya said, ""Between sixhundred to seven-hundred."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     A man came to the Prophet and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have enlisted in the army for such-andsuch Ghazwa, and my wife is leaving for Hajj."" Allah's Apostle said, ""Go back and perform Hajj with your wife."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Az-Zuhri:                     as follows in Hadith 297.Narrated Abu Huraira:We were in the company of Allah's Apostle in a Ghazwa, and he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, ""This (man) is from the people of the (Hell) Fire."" When the battle started, the man fought violently till he got wounded. Somebody said, ""O Allah's Apostle! The man whom you described as being from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died."" The Prophet said, ""He will go to the (Hell) Fire."" Some people were on the point of doubting (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, ""Allah is Greater! I testify that I am Allah's Slave and His Apostle."" Then he ordered Bilal to announce amongst the people: 'None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Allah may support this religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.'"
Sarah,30," Narrated Anas bin Malik:                     Allah's Apostle delivered a sermon and said, ""Zaid received the flag and was martyred, then Ja`far took it and was martyred, then `Abdullah bin Rawaha took it and was martyred, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took it without being appointed, and Allah gave him victory."" The Prophet added, ""I am not pleased (or they will not be pleased) that they should remain (alive) with us,"" while his eyes were shedding tears."
Sarah,30,"      Narrated Anas:                          The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usiya and Bani Lihyan came      to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they      requested him to support them with some men to fight their own people.     The Prophet supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we      used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut      wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the      (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi'r-Ma'ana where they      betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe      of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan for one month in the prayer.     Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used to recite      a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:-- ""O Allah! Let      our people be informed on our behalf that we have met our Lord Who has     got pleased with us and made us pleased."" Then the Verse was      cancelled."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Talha:                     Whenever the Prophet conquered some people, he would stay in their town for three days."

Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi' (ra):                      A horse of Ibn 'Umar fled and the enemy took it. Then the Muslims conquered the enemy and the horse was returned to him during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger (). And also, once a slave of Ibn 'Umar (ra) fled and joined the Byzantines, and when the Muslims conquered them, Khalid bin Al-Walid returned the slave to him after the death of the Prophet ()."
Sarah,30," Narrated Nafi`:                     Once a slave of Ibn `Umar fled and joined the Byzantine. Khalid bin Al-Walid got him back and returned him to `Abdullah (bin `Umar). Once a horse of Ibn `Umar also ran away and followed the Byzantines, and he (i.e. Khalid) got it back and returned it to `Abdullah."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Umar:                     That he was riding a horse on the day, the Muslims fought (against the Byzantines), and the commander of the Muslim army was Khalid bin Al-Walid who had been appointed by Abu Bakr. The enemy took the horse away, and when the enemy was defeated, Khalid returned the horse to him."
Sarah,30," Narrated Jabir bin `Abdullah:                     I said, ""O Allah's Apostle! We have slaughtered a young sheep of ours and have ground one Sa of barley. So, I invite you along with some persons."" So, the Prophet said in a loud voice, ""O the people of the Trench! Jabir had prepared ""Sur"" so come along."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Um Khalid:                     (the daughter of Khalid bin Sa`id) I went to Allah's Apostle with my father and I was Nearing a yellow shirt. Allah's Apostle said, ""Sanah, Sanah!"" (`Abdullah, the narrator, said that 'Sanah' meant 'good' in the Ethiopian language). I then started playing with the seal of Prophethood (in between the Prophet's shoulders) and my father rebuked me harshly for that. Allah's Apostle said. ""Leave her,"" and then Allah's Apostle (invoked Allah to grant me a long life) by saying (thrice), ""Wear this dress till it is worn out and then wear it till it is worn out, and then wear it till it is worn out."" (The narrator adds, ""It is said that she lived for a long period, wearing that (yellow) dress till its color became dark because of long wear."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     Al-Hasan bin 'All took a date from the dates of the Sadaqa and put it in his mouth. The Prophet said (to him) in Persian, ""Kakh, kakh! (i.e. Don't you know that we do not eat the Sadaqa (i.e. what is given in charity) (charity is the dirt of the people))."
Sarah,30," Narrated Abu Huraira:                     The Prophet got up amongst us and mentioned Al Ghulul, emphasized its magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, ""Don't commit Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of Ressurection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will be saying: 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I will reply, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you Nor should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel that will be grunting. Such a man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me, and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you,' or one carrying over his neck gold and silver and saying, 'O Allah's Apostle! Intercede with Allah for me,' and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you,' or one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, and the man will say, 'O Allah's Apostle!

Sarah,30," Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:                     My grandfather, Rafi` said, ""We were in the company of the Prophet at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah's Permission). On that the Prophet said, 'Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way."" My grandfather asked (the Prophet ), ""We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?"" Allah's Apostle replied, ""If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Allah's Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won't use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians."""
Sarah,30," Narrated Qais:                     Jarir bin `Abdullah said to me, ""Allah's Apostle said to me, 'Won't you relieve me from Dhul- Khalasa?' Dhul-Khalasa was a house where the tribe of Khatham used to stay, and it used to be called Ka`bat-ul Yamaniya. So I proceeded with one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, 'O Allah! Make him firm and a guiding and rightly-guided man."" Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah's Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to Allah's Apostle. ""O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel (covered with tar)."" So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of Ahmas five times."
Sarah,30," Narrated Ibn `Abbas:                     The Prophet said, on the day of the Conquest of Mecca, ""There is no migration (after the Conquest), but Jihad and good intentions, and when you are called for Jihad, you should immediately respond to the call."""

I heard him saying: Once the Prophet sent me and Az-Zubair saying, 'Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, 'Hatib has not given me any letter.' We said to her. 'Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, 'Don't hurry in judging me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and property).' The Prophet believed him. `Umar said, 'Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib's) neck as he has done hypocrisy.' The Prophet said, (to `Umar), 'Who knows, perhaps Allah has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), 'Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.' "" `Abdur-Rahman added, ""So this is what encouraged him (i.e. `Ali)."

His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. Abu Talha jumped from his camel and said, ""O Allah's Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for you."" The Prophet said, ""Take care of the lady."" So, Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and went to Safiya and covered her with it, and then he set right the condition of their shecamel so that both of them rode, and we were encircling Allah's Apostle like a cover.

Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, ""O Allah's Apostle! May Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get hurt?"" The Prophet replied,""No, but take care of the lady."" Abu Talha covered his face with his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his garment, and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and both of them (i.e. the Prophet and his wife) rode and proceeded till they approached Medina.

When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two shecamels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, ""Who has done this?"" The people replied, ""Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in this house."" I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet asked. ""What is wrong with you."" I replied, ""O Allah's Apostle! I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some drunks."" The Prophet then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Apostle started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Allah's Apostle and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, ""Aren't you but the slaves of my father?"" Allah's Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Apostle retreated, and we went out with him."

Abu Bakr said to her, ""Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)."" Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle. She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Allah's Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, ""I will not leave anything Allah's Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's tradition, then I would go astray."" (Later on) `Umar gave the Prophet's property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to `Ali and `Abbas, but he withheld the properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, ""These two properties are the Sadaqa which Allah's Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted to the ruler."" (Az-Zuhrl said, ""They have been managed in this way till today."")"
Sarah,30," Narrated Malik bin Aus:                     While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of `Umar bin Al- Khattab came to me and said, ""The chief of the believers has sent for you."" So, I went along with him till I entered the place where `Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, ""O Malik! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them."" I said, ""O chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it."" He said, ""O man! Take it."" While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, ""`Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az-Zubair and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?"" `Umar said, ""Yes"", So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa' came again and said, ""May I admit `Ali and `Abbas?"" `Umar said, ""yes."" So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then `Abbas said, ""O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. `Ali)."" They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. `Uthman and his companions) said, ""O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other."" `Umar said, ""Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Allah's Apostle said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and Allah's Apostle meant himself (by saying ""we'')?"" The group said, ""He said so."" `Umar then turned to `Ali and `Abbas and said, ""I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah's Apostle said so?"" They replied, "" He said so."" `Umar then said, ""So, I will talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else."" `Umar then recited the Holy Verses: ""What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will 'And Allah is able to do all things."" 9:6) `Umar added ""So this property was especially given to Allah's Apostle, but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah's Apostle used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Allah 's Cause. Allah 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?"" They replies in the affirmative. `Umar then said to `Ali and `Abbas. ""I ask you by Allah, do you know this?"" `Umar added, ""When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Allah's Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Allah's Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightlyguided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah's Apostle used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and `Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, `Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your nephew's property, and this man, i.e. `Ali, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's property. I told you both that Allah's Apostle said, 'Our (prophets') properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).' When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah's Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah's Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over to us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?"" The group aid, ""Yes."" Then `Umar faced `Ali and `Abbas saying, ""I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?"" They said, ""Yes. "" He said, "" Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf."""

So please order us some instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and also invite our people whom we left behind us to observe as well.""
